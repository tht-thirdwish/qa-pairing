These radical rollbacks cover the \u201cintermediate period\u201d following a radiation release and could last for up to several years. This plan is in its final stage of approval.\nThe documents indicate that the plan\u2019s rationale is rooted in public relations, not public health. Following Japan\u2019s Fukushima meltdown in 2011, EPA\u2019s claims that no radioactivity could reach the U.S. at levels of concern were contradicted by its own rainwater measurements showing contamination from Fukushima throughout the U.S. well above Safe Drinking Water Act limits. In reaction, EPA prepared new limits 1000s of times higher than even the Fukushima rainwater because \u201cEPA experienced major difficulties conveying to the public that the detected levels\u2026were not of immediate concern for public health.\u201d\nWhen EPA published for public comment the proposed \u201cProtective Action Guides,\u201d it hid proposed new concentrations for all but four of the 110 radionuclides covered, and refused to reveal how much they were above Safe Drinking Water Act limits. It took a lawsuit to get EPA to release documents showing that \u2013\n- The proposed PAGs for two radionuclides (Cobalt-60 and Calcium-45) are more than 10,000 times Safe Drinking Water Act limits.

Randolph, Jr.\nProfessor of Law\nUMKC School of Law\nVENDOR/PURCHASER; INSTALLMENT LAND CONTRACTS; RESTRAINTS ON ALIENATION: Covenant giving installment seller right to participate in profits of subsequent sale of the property invalid as an unreasonable restraint on alienation, at least if covenant operative over signficant period of time.\nLafond v. Rumler, L.C. No. 95-071226-CZ (Mich. App. 11/18/97)\nSeller and buyer contracted for an installment sale (or contract for deed) of certain property for $60,000. The buyer was to pay $20,000 down. During negotiations, another buyer had offerred seller $80,000 for the property. Seller nevertheless agreed to a contract with the first buyer, as the first buyer was offerring a substantial cash down payment. Nevertheless, seller and buyer included a clause that was designed to permit seller to share the profit if buyer resold the property to the $80,000 buyer thereafter.\nThe clause provided as follows:\n\"[If] porperty is sold, bartered, transferred or otherwise disposed of, by the vendee within 15 years from the date of this land contract, it is agreed . . . that any sale over the amount of $60,000 [plus taxes apparently equal to $10,000) . . . shall be divided equally between the vendor and vendee of this land contract.\nSale price will not be arbitrary. Purchaser [sic] must get written permission from sellers or their agent before accepting any offer. Sellers [sic] reserves the right to reject any offer in its entirety, subsequent disputes will be setltled by [here followed an appraisal device].\nAs an example, if the property should be sold for $100K, the vendor and vendee would equally divide $30,000 or the exess of the $60K plus taxes stated above. This amendment shall be binding on any assigness or beneficiaries of the vendee.\"\nWhen the first buyer approached the $80,000, that buyer indicated that it also wanted to purchase on an installment land contract. But the original seller rejected this proposal, insisting on an all cash purchase. The first buyer then brought suit to nullify the resale clause quoted above on the grounds that it constituted an unreasonable restraint on alienation. The trial court found that the buyer had knowingly and willingly entered into the contract, but nevertheless found that the resale clause constituted an unreasonable restraint on alienation, and excised it from the contract.\nThe court reviewed prior Michigan case law upholding forfeiture restraints predicated on resale of the property. It pointed out that more recent authority had been more cautious in evaluating such forfeiture clauses, finding them enforceable only when they served a legtimate interest in protecting seller against \"waste or impairment or loss of security.\"\nThe court appeared to assume that the covenant in question would have been enforceable if applied to the first projected sale (to the $80,000 buyer.) Although, of course, even here the effect of the covenant would have been to reward the seller with a higher return on the sale, and not to protect against waste or loss of security, the restraint on alienation would have been minimal because the resale would have occurred promptly and in accordance with a preexisting plan. But when, through no fault of the first buyer, the sale fell through, a continued participa", "I have been browsing the blogsphere for the past couple of days now reading up on some of the feedback some Microsoft Community blogs have been receiving for receiving hardware with Microsoft software.

An understanding of these interactions is required if biological systems are to be comprehended at the molecular level. The combined tools of molecular biology, computational biology, NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography are used to provide important information to aid in our understanding of these interactions. Our research efforts have been directed at enzyme-substrate interactions, protein-lipid interactions, antibody-antigen interactions, RNA structure, and protein-nucleic acid interactions. Current areas of research are briefly described below.\nEnzyme-Substrate Interactions: Glutathione transferases are cellular detoxification enzymes. As such, they play an important role in the protection of an organism from carcinogens and other toxic chemicals. Current efforts in my laboratory are directed at correlating substrate specificity and enzymatic mechanism with protein dynamics and substrate-protein interactions. This is a collaborative project with Dr. Saxena at the University of Pittsburgh (Chemistry).\nProtein-DNA Interactions: In collaboration with Dr. Jen-Jacobson at the University of Pittsburgh (Biological Sciences) we are using NMR spectroscopy and thermodynamic measurements to understand the recognition of specific DNA sequences by restriction endonucleases.\nThymidylate Kinase: We are using biophysical and computational tools to develop inhibitors of thymidylate kinases which are potential anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-malarial drugs.\nAutomated NMR assignments: A key bottleneck in the analysis of NMR data is the assignment of resonance lines to atoms in the protein.

Instead, if the original seller rejects the proposed price, the acceptability of the sale would be in the hands of appraisers, through a relatively time consuming process. This certainly would \"chill\" any prospective buyer, leading to a lower ultimate sale price for the property.\nThe court also pointed out that the buyer was inhibited in improving the property, because part of the benefit of any improvements might redound to the original seller. Although the court included this factor as part of its discussion of the restraint on alienation, it did not point out why it would be relevant to that analysis.\nThe court pointed out that, although the parties provided that the restriction \"ran with the land,\" the fatal defect is present even when there has been no transfer, even while the property is in the hands of the original buyer.\nComment 1: Note that the trial court here thoughtfully delineated the issue in sharp detail. The contract was entered into \"knowingly and willingly.\" Although the parties had a certain purpose in mind - the $80, 000 buyer - they clearly executed a provision far broader than necessary to deal with that purpose. Further, the court does not make its decision turn on the fact that the original seller (arguably unresonably) rejected the contract from the $80,000 buyer. It simply points out that if the seller had agreed to that contract, there would have been no long term restraint on alienation.\nComment 2: Michigan is America's \"installment land sale contract\" capital. The device is quite commonly used and liberally enforced in that state, both in commercial and residential transactions, unlike the more cautious treatment given to it elsewhere. Nevertheless, the court here rejects some earlier authority permitting per se restraints on alienation in such contracts and adopts instead a \"rule of reason approach.\" Although the editor is a \"freedom of contract\" freak, the editor recognizes a necessary protective doctrine when he sees one, and agrees that courts ought to have some power to deny enforcement to anti-contract arrangements such as significant restraints on alienation.\nItems in the Daily Development section generally are extracted from the Quarterly Report on Developments in Real Estate Law, published by the ABA Section on Real Property, Probate & Trust Law.

In most cases, if you are healthy, have a realistic expectation for how you will look post-treatment, and do not have any medical conditions that may impair you from healing properly post-surgery, you are a good candidate for this procedure.View Before & After Gallery\nMost of our Chicago buttocks implant patients find it necessary to stop working for a few days and heal following surgery, though the recovery time is usually fairly short compared to more intensive surgeries.\nSwelling is a very common side effect during recovery, so you may experience a decrease in the size of your buttocks as you heal. That\u2019s normal and to be expected. Dr. Shifrin will give you step-by-step recovery instructions, a detailed timeline for your butt implant recovery, and his personal cell phone number so you can contact him if you have any questions or concerns. This one-on-one attention is what makes Dr. Shifrin such a trusted surgeon to his patients.\nOnce your swelling goes down and your recovery is complete, you will begin to notice your implants settle into their final position.\nHowever, the end result will still be firm, round, and beautiful. You will notice that your clothes fit differently (you may need to go up a jean size depending on the level of implant you choose), and your figure will feel more proportional. You will also notice a swelling of confidence when you look at your curvy new butt! Butt implant surgery is one of those procedures that gets noticed without getting noticed. People may remark that your figure looks great or ask if you\u2019ve been working out. It seems counterintuitive, but increasing the size of your butt can actually have a slimming effect on your torso. It\u2019s all about proportions!\nOur Chicago buttocks implant patients trust Dr. Shifrin for his expertise, training, and experience to achieve their back side goals.\nDiscover what others know and visit us for a personal consultation.

Age, gravity, heredity, and weight fluctuations are common impediments to having an attractive, shapely backside. When diet and exercise just aren\u2019t enough, the answer may be buttocks reshaping with implants. Buttock augmentation at David Shifrin MD can sculpt your backside to help create a healthy, curvy silhouette. We strive to deliver the best butt implants Chicago has to offer!\nIn patients lacking enough excess fat for fat transfer alone, traditional buttocks implants are used to add volume and shape.\nButtocks implants were first popularized in Brazil and subsequently used in Mexico and Europe. Made of stable silicone gel, the implants have been used safely in the United States for years. The implants are placed through an incision hidden in the native cleft between the buttocks cheeks and are used to lift and project the back side. Dr. Shifrin specifically tailors the choice of implant shape and size to your particular body and desired outcome. In patients who have available excess fat from areas such as the abdomen, flanks, love handles, or back, transferring this fat into the buttocks region to further reshape and add volume in addition to the butt implants is frequently done.\nBenefits of buttock implants include fuller, curvier buttocks and a more shapely figure. In addition to physical benefits, buttocks implants can give a boost to your self-esteem and sexual confidence. The procedure can also help correct for the effects of aging or weight loss. Buttocks implants are often done with breast augmentation to ensure a proportional silhouette.\nAttention to Detail\nDr. David Shifrin became one of the nation\u2019s leading plastic surgeons for buttocks implants by making sure his patients love their results. He does this by being personally involved in each case from the initial consultation through recovery.\nStarting with your initial consultation, Dr. Shifrin will answer all of your questions and help you craft a surgery plan that\u2019s right for your body and goals. When it comes to surgery day, Dr. Shifrin will insert a silicone implant into each side of your buttocks. These implants are placed through incisions that are made along either side of your gluteal cleft (the crease at which your buttocks meet), making them virtually invisible once your recovery is complete.Request Consultation\nIf you are healthy enough for surgery and want a rounder, fuller backside, you are likely a good candidate for buttocks implants.

Cruz posits that Christians do not commit acts of terror because if Christians commit them as acts motivated by their faith, those acts might step over the line of what is legal--and should be condemned as such when they occur--but because their cause is grounded in principles that he shares, those acts would not constitute terrorism.\nIn the second Republican debate, Carly Fiorina offered the most passionate anti-abortion call to action among the candidates with her testimony regarding a video showing the vivisection of a live fetus--a video that it turned out does not exist in the form she suggested. Fiorina, more than any other candidate, should not have been surprised if it turns out that Robert Lewis Dear was inspired by her words. Abortion has long been an irresolvable chasm in our politics. A woman's right to chose and a fetus's status as a living being set those on each side on a seemingly irreconcilable collision course. If one believes that a fetus is from conception a life endowed with all of the rights of any human being, then what Fiorina claimed to have seen is an abomination that might well in the minds of extremists warrant the action that Robert Lewis Dear--like others before him--took to act against the slaughter of innocents. Instead of deflecting blame for the actions that her words might have incited, perhaps Fiorina should have been true to her convictions and stood with a man who by all appearances put his own life on the line in response to rhetoric similar to her words of passion.\nIf we are going to use the language of terrorism, we have to be careful to apply it consistently. We cannot apply different standards because a person is Christian or because they are white, as some felt the New York Times did in its description of Robert Lewis Dear as \"a gentle loner who occasionally unleashed violent acts towards neighbors and women he knew.\" Given the current usage of the term, Dear should be labeled a terrorist if he did what he appears to have done. But we should not be surprised if doing so, in our current political landscape, turns out to be an unproductive step.\nWhat Robert Lewis Dear did was terrifying and barbaric, and it is becoming increasingly clear that his actions were inspired by the anti-abortion meme. But it is not useful to label any crazy person who does horrific things a terrorist, however much the old definitions might fit. We have to be cognizant in this debate that the global war on terror changed everything, particularly the language of terrorism. Terrorism is no longer simply a word used to describe a political tactic, but has become a moral absolute, a designation of evil. It may be that the word has lost its salience for the application to events of \"domestic terrorism\" that lack an organized, systematic framework, and to which the anti-terrorism tools and tactics do not apply.\nIn his speech declaring the global war on terror, President George Bush assigned equal moral culpability to those who commit acts of terror and those who support them. Translated into our domestic landscape, this suggests that an acknowledgement by Carly Fiorina or Ted Cruz that their rhetoric may have inspired Dear's actions could imply culpability for a terrorist act. Even if that is exactly what their political antagonists would love to see, it would only take us farther down a slippery slope in a year when political rhetoric has already begun to test the limits of what a democracy can tolerate. Instead, we need to move in the opposite direction, and those who assign these labels might begin to consider language that reframes the issue in a way that allows people to confront the linkages between incendiary language in the public square and the violence that can ensue, without falling into the trap of debating who is a terrorist and who is not.", "ate to high|\n|Indoor / outdoor||Both|\n|Training level||Ongoing training & socialising|\n|Adoption fee *Plus council registration if adopted in NSW||*$500 See notes below|\n*The adoption fee includes microchipping on the NSW Companion Animal Register, desexing, C5 vaccination,intestinal worm and flea treatment.

Rule", "What type of production is The Royal Ballet presenting that is based on a classic tale", "Connecticut Law Firm Broder & Orland, LLC (along with its founding partner Carole Topol Orland, Esq.) is facing serious allegations in a lawsuit filed by the firm\u2019s former employee, Kathleen Russell. Ms. Russell, former assistant of Ms. Orland, alleges that she was fired so that the firm would not have to pay her the proper benefits under the firm\u2019s ERISA retirement plan and that she was not properly compensated for all the hours that she worked.\nKathleen Russell was initially hired on January 3, 2013 as a temporary receptionist. Eventually, she became Orland\u2019s assistant. During her employment with Broder & Orland, Russell alleged that she worked no less than 48 hours per week, but also had periods where she worked in excess of 50 hours per week as Carole Topol Orland\u2019s assistant. She also alleged that she worked through her lunch period and was expected to respond to emails from Orland even during her scheduled time off. Ms. Russell\u2019s complaint stated she made an annual salary of $55,000.00. Russell alleges through her attorney, Anthony R. Minchella of Minchella & Associates, LLC, that she was not properly compensated for her work in excess of 40 hours each week, that her employer knew she worked through lunch, and that the firm did not keep proper records of the hours she worked and the pay she was entitled to receive.\nMs. Russell also alleged that she was terminated on November 4, 2016 around 1:00 PM because \u201cthe firm had grown and their needs changed.\u201d Ms. Russell was over the age of 55 when she worked for Broder & Orland and was required to be part of a defined benefit plan. This plan was implemented one year after Ms. Russell was hired. The firm acted as the fiduciary and had control of the operation and administration of the plan. Ms. Russell alleged in her complaint that she was fired in order to stop her from being properly vested and so that the senior partners could increase their contributions into the plan without paying her the same benefits. It is alleged that Broder & Orland, LLC violated their position as fiduciary of the plan by not acting in Ms. Russell\u2019s best interest as a participant.\nIn other words the lawsuit alleges that Russell was fired by Orland so the partners could make more money and not pay their employees a lawful wage!\nMs. Russell has asked the court for back pay, front pay, reinstatement, compensatory damages, punitive damages, liquidated damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, an accounting of the ERISA benefit plan (including individual and matching contributions), costs, and any other legal and equitable relief the court would grant. Generally awards for punitive damages are not covered by law firms insurance policies, meaning that the Carol Topol Orland and her firm may have to pay for damages out of their own pockets. Russell also requested a trial by jury.\nDid Broder & Orland Violate Federal and State Employment Laws? Maybe.\nUltimately, it will be up to the jury to decide whether Broder & Orland violated federal and Connecticut state employment laws. Yet, it\u2019s important to explain the basics of federal and state employment law because they apply to anyone who is employed.\nIn our view this lawsuit doesn\u2019t look good for the firm, even if the case settles or the allegations are found to not have merit.\nMs. Russell alleges that Broder & Orland, LLC along with Carole Topol Orland, Esq., violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by not paying her for the more than 40 hours each week that she routinely worked. Under the FLSA, employees may be considered exempt from overtime pay or non-exempt. Yet, employers can\u2019t just pick and choose who will be considered exempt and who won\u2019t. It\u2019s also not just decided by who is paid an annual salary. Salaried workers, such as Ms. Russell, can be considered non-exempt.\nIf it were only based on salary, Kathleen Russell may have been considered exempt. Yet, under FLSA we also have to look at the type of work that the employee performs. Going back to her complaint, Ms. Russell alleged some key items:\n- She routinely worked more than 40 hours per week.\n- She was not allowed to order items for the firm\u2019s kitchen or for office supplies.\n- She was reprimanded for once spending $100.00 to store files that were scheduled for shredding.\n- She was expected to respond to emails even during her scheduled time off.\nEven without any sort of legal training, it\u2019s plain to see that based on the second and third points Ms. Russell needed to get the firm\u2019s permission to do just about anything. The FLSA does state that some administrative and professional employees can be classified as exempt, but they must have the authority to act with discretion in signif", "Enter programming of the ACC-950 by entering *123456#\nIn step 3: Enter 00001 as your starting user number\nstep 4: Enter the amount of users that you want to give acces to -\nExample: if you want to give access to 100 users you would enter 00100.\nIf you want to program Card or Pin use the instruct", "Why does the author express sadness regarding the feedback received by Brandon Leblanc", "icant matters. In the complaint and according to FLSA standards, Ms. Russell clearly was not allowed to act with discretion in significant matters. Under the FLSA, when an employee does not have authority to act with a certain amount of discretion, they are considered non-exempt (even if they are salaried) and they are entitled to overtime pay.\nWith regards to the first point, Ms. Russell stated in her complaint that her scheduled hours were 8:30 am to 5:30 pm during the week days. She also stated that she was often there early and stayed late because \u201cBroder and Carole Topol Orland, Esq. expected her to answer [the phone]\u201d even if it rang at or after 5:30 pm. Ms. Russell further alleged that she was expected to respond in a timely manner to emails she received during her scheduled time off and was required to do so using her personal computer or tablet.\nConnecticut state law, also cited in the lawsuit, has its own \u201cduties test\u201d to help determine whether an employee is exempt or non-exempt. Although there are administrative and professional exceptions, Ms. Russell would have needed to supervise other people and be able to exercise independent judgment in her duties in order to be considered exempt under state law.\nAgain, the jury will be the decision-maker when it comes to whether Kathleen Russell should have been paid overtime by Broder & Orland, LLC because of her consistent schedule of more than 40 hours each week. For we, the people, to keep up with and understand the case at hand as it moves forward it is important to understand the duties and pay associated with whether an employee is legally exempt or non-exempt. This cursory glance certainly gives credibility to the plaintiff and her legal team.\nERISA & Fiduciary Duties\nERISA is another federal law that Ms. Russell alleges her former employer (namely, Carole Topol Orland, Esq., and her firm Broder & Orland, LLC) violated. ERISA is an acronym for Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. It puts minimum standards into place for private industry (non-government employers) retirement plans. To be a defined plan, it must be employer funded, promise a specific monthly benefit for retirement, or tell you how to figure out what you\u2019ll get each month when you retire.\nTo participate in the plan, you have work for the employer for a certain amount of time or a certain amount of hours. With this type of plan, employees are immediately vested in their own contributions and their earnings. When an employer matches, it takes longer to fully vest on that money. Generally, employees have to work around seven years to be fully vested. Of course, this can also depend on the type of ERISA plan in place.\nWhen someone is named as a fiduciary of anything, it means that they have a legal obligation to do what is in the best interest of the recipient(s). Ms. Russell alleges that her termination stopped her from becoming 60% vested and prevented her from receiving all of the benefits that she should have received. She also alleged that the firm violated its fiduciary responsibilities toward her as a recipient of the ERISA plan.\nWe\u2019ve reached to Carole Topol Orland for comment before this story was published, but she was unavailable. USA Herald invites Ms. Orland to contact us with a statement related to this matter if she wishes to do so.\nNo One Is Above the Law, Including Carole Topol Orland\nSay what you will above state and federal government, but when it comes to employment law, we have excellent regulations put into place to protect workers like Kathleen Russell. Whether someone is entitled to overtime pay isn\u2019t (thankfully) at the sole discretion of employers. Both federal and state laws guide employers (and inform employees) about the actual duties the employee would need in order for the employer to not compensate for overtime. The same can be said for retirement. It\u2019s up to we, the people, to understand the law and to know our rights so that we can protect ourselves and ensure that we\u2019re able to sufficiently provide for ourselves once we hit retirement age. If you have questions about whether your employer should pay you for overtime or about your retirement account, contact a reputable licensed employment law attorney in your area. Licensed attorneys are the only people allowed to give legal advice\nWe will continue to provide updates to our readers related to this important employment law case.

Terrorism is generally defined as a tactic using violence or the threat of violence to inspire fear in pursuit of a political goal.\nThe question raised by the editors points to the difficulty--and in their view the importance--of how we label incidents like this. Because of the prominence of Planned Parenthood as a political issue raised by Republicans over the past several months, people quickly looked to see how the Republican presidential candidates would respond to the question the editors raised. Mike Huckabee, a candidate with impeccable anti-abortion credentials who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, held down the straightforward, call-a-spade-a-spade, end of the spectrum when he declared that Dear's action was domestic terrorism. Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz hunkered down at the other end of the spectrum. Cruz took pains to suggest all manner of alternative explanations for why Dear did what he did--most remarkable of which was that Dear may be a transgendered leftist activist--in a strikingly defensive effort to deflect any culpability from his own anti-Planned Parenthood vitriol of the past few months. The queen of anti-Planned Parenthood vitriol, Carly Fiorina, launched a leftists-at-the-gates counter offensive.\nNewspaper editors know better than most--their jobs are literally about parsing words and meaning after all--that terrorism is a highly subjective term. The use of the term terrorist today cannot be divorced from the language of the global war on terrorism (GWOT) declared by the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. One of the consequences of the GWOT is that it has provided a vocabulary that has come to be used by governments across the globe to label one's opponents in morally absolute terms, and in turn for sanctioning all manner of state action against them. Vladimir Putin rose quickly to our defense after the 9/11 attacks, as he saw in our determination to go to war half-way around the world under the banner of the GWOT a post-hoc justification for his own wars against Chechen separatists.\nThere are myriad other examples of how the language of terrorism has since been used. Bashir al-Assad used the language of terrorism in the early days of civil protests against his regime, as he quickly labeled real and manufactured events as the work of terrorists to justify the tenor of the regime's own violent assault against its own people. China has used the language of the GWOT to justify its suppression of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang and Buddhists in Tibet. In Myanmar, the Buddhist majority and Muslim minority has struggled for the linguistic upper hand, as each has labeled the other side as the terrorists. Terrorism is both a tactic utilized against a state or other more powerful adversary, and a propaganda tool, in the GWOT context, used by those in power for the labeling of their enemy and the justification for means used to defeat it.\nEach of these circumstances suggests the subjective nature of the terrorist label. Terrorism is what we call what the other guys do--the bad guys. That suggests why Ted Cruz cannot allow the murders in Colorado to be labeled an act of terrorism. While Robert Lewis Dear may (or may not) have been inspired by Cruz's history of vitriolic attacks on the evils of Planned Parenthood, Ted Cruz does not view his own rhetoric as extreme. To Ted Cruz, the other guys are the extremists, while he is a strict constitutionalist advocating for what he believes would be the mainstream of American thought if America had not deviated from its founding principles.\nWhen Ted Cruz advocated admitting Syrian Christian refugees into the United States, because \"there is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror,\" he was not denying that Christians--notably anti-abortion activists wi", "le at that point.\nStandard cake flavors and icings start at $5.25 per serving.
