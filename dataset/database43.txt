Experts say the hard work of living again is just beginning for the children who survived or lost siblings in the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. RA Archive|\nAs the holiday glow and international media spotlight fade, they leave behind lives still shattered by a senseless spray of bullets. And for the children who survived or lost siblings in the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, now begins the hard work of living again.\n\"Most of the time, what would be is that people have an incredible amount of resilience,\" said Dr. Sander Koyfman, the medical director of Adult Inpatient Psychiatry at Kings County Hospital in New York and president of a volunteer group that responds to disasters. \"They may be scarred, but they manage to persevere.\"\nBut before children can work through their emotions and rebuild their lives, experts say parents and teachers must first learn how the trauma affected each child.\n\"Kids don't process the way adults do,\" said Barbara Van Dahlen, a child psychologist and founder of Give an Hour, a network of volunteer mental health professionals. \"They don't talk about what happened.\"\nInstead, children might have trouble sleeping or concentrating at school. They could lash out, lose their appetite, become irritable or grow sad or worried.\nAnd children react differently depending on pre-existing problems or the specific nature of their experience. Risk factors for adverse reactions include the death of a family member, friend or schoolmate; observing someone's death or injury; getting hurt or sick because of the event; or the inability to evacuate the building quickly.\n\"They learn no matter what, the world can be a very dangerous, frightening place,\" Van Dahlen said. \"It takes them a lot of time to process that. Some kids will pack it all away and look fine. And a few months later it will all start to unravel.\"\nExperts counsel the importance of creating routine and structure, while listening to children and watching their behavior for clues into their psyche.\n\"You can't just smother them with what you think is love,\" Van Dahlen said. \"It's this careful observation and then trial and error. Because we don't know what will help them. And every kid is different. Just like us.\"\nThe Sandy Hook shooting presents a particularly difficult problem because of the tremendous amount of media attention it drew to the town. Every news item or memorial can provide a trigger for a child to re-experience trauma. And coping with the more immediate stress of trauma can get in the way of the process of grieving and moving on.\n\"The really good news is that we have come quite a long way in mental health in understanding the impact of these kinds of events on children,\" said Robin H. Gurwitch, a psychologist at Duke University Medical Center and member of the American Psychological Association's National Disaster Response Network. \"There have been tremendous gains on evidence-based interventions that we know work, that we know help children in their learning and recovery.\"\nInterventions can involve relaxation exercises such as one Gurwitch uses to teach children to breathe slowly while thinking of a positive color infusing their bodies to make them feel good while expelling dark colors and feelings.\nAnd while risk factors can lead to difficulties, protective factors can contribute to healthy outcomes. They include the steady presence of caring, supportive adults who are themselves coping well. And having a routine.\nBut there will always be potentially disruptive firsts after the event -- such as first holidays and the first day back at school -- and Gurwitch counsels parents and teachers to be prepared.\n\"Even as everyone starts doing better, all those firsts will kick it back up again,\" she said. \"And if (the children) can anticipate it, it's not that scary when it happens.\"\nTeachers and parents should answer children's questions directly, assuage their fears with information about efforts to improve safety, protect them from anything that could trigger additional trauma, and provide openings to discuss the event without forcing the issue.\n\"Do something real that lets the child understand we are acknowledging and understand their fear,\" said Marleen Wong, director of the Trauma Services Adaptation Center For Resilience, Hope and Wellness in Schools with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. \"Because they feel they're alone. And that's the worst thing.\"\nSchools should have an abundance of counselors available, allowing teachers to focus on teaching while also attending to student needs as time passes, Wong said. She praised efforts at Columbine High School in Colorado after the school shooting there in 1999.\n\"They just made a decision that no matter what was going on with those kids, the teachers took them by the hand and said you have to talk to the counselor,\" Wong said. \"It", "When you think about all the rooms in your home, which one gets used the most?

Since then, we\u2019ve put those funds to work and have been busy growing Stashbee and developing our world-class website. We have now onboarded over 820,000 square feet of leasable space onto Stashbee. In terms of square footage, that makes us the 8th largest storage provider in the UK.\nIn many areas, space has never been at such a premium, and we live in an era where people have more belongings than ever before. Stashbee is on a mission to make finding and booking storage space easy, convenient and affordable for everyone, everywhere.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re building the UK\u2019s leading platform for storage space.\nOur easy-to-use platform connects individuals and businesses who have spare space (garages & lock-ups, spare rooms, parking spaces, warehouses and self-storage facilities) with those who need it for storage, long-term parking and warehousing. It\u2019s one place for all your storage needs!\nOur vision is to become the number 1 global destination for storage. We\u2019re building the one-stop-shop for people to easily find and book any kind of storage space; whatever their need, and wherever they are.\nPeople and businesses are increasingly looking beyond their homes and offices for storage space. But finding it is not easy. There are a limited range of local options available, prices are often opaque and it can be tricky to compare alternatives.\nMeanwhile, we estimate that there are 1.5 billion square feet of under-utilised space in warehouses, spare rooms & garages right across the UK which is sitting idle and untapped; with no simple and secure solution to monetise it.\nStashbee harnesses the power of the sharing economy to provide a hassle-free way for individuals and businesses to earn money from their idle space, whilst offering existing storage businesses a simple way to advertise and manage their available space.\nSubstantial accomplishments to date\n\u2705 Stashbee now has 820,000+ square feet of leasable spare space on its platform (that\u2019s equivalent to 28 traditional self storage facilities)\n\u2705 In the 12 months to March \u201819, our Host network has grown by over 1130%.

Dr Ignatius Kaigama said hate speech among youths using social media was spreading like a virus and government must stop being reactive to such issues and find proactive ways of dealing with them.\nHe said, \u201cWe wait until there is fire before we act and because of that, lives are lost and we spend more resources to restore peace. Our style in this meeting is to act by mapping out strategies to prevent crisis before it starts.

We call on all parents, religious and community leaders to caution their children and followers against making provocative and inciting comments.\n- We also appreciate the current peace we are enjoying in Jos town and surrounding but we decry the increasing cases of criminality and lawlessness and urge that they be curtailed. We observe in addition to car and battery stealing, motorcycles still operate in some locations in defiance to the directive by Government banning them. We also observed that tricycles still operate beyond their restricted time and when security agents arrest them, they are alleged to pay bribe and are allowed to continue operating, this has resulted in increased crime and insecurity.\n- We wish to caution our youth to stop beating the drums of war and also fanning the embers of division that can threaten the peace of the country.

Alb\u00e9niz invites the listener to join him on a musical journey through eight great Spanish cities, each steeped in tradition, investing each scene with local colouring as an homage.

Today I want to talk about the difference between the two words patience and patients. These words, despite having different meanings altogether, are spelled closely to one another and are what is known as homophones.\nIn this post, I want to go over their definitions, the functions they have in sentences, and give you a few tips to remember how to use them correctly. After reading this post, you won\u2019t ever mix up patience vs. patients again.\nWhen to Use Patience\nPatience is a noun and is defined as, \u201cthe capacity, quality, or fact of being patient.\u201d Now I know what you\u2019re thinking. This doesn\u2019t help us out very much because this definition is just citing \u201cpatient\u201d and not telling us what the root word means.\nFor that we\u2019ll have to look at the word \u201cpatient\u201d itself. Patient, in this sense, is an adjective and is defined as, \u201cable to accept or tolerate delays, problems, or suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious.\u201d Now that we have that cleared up, let\u2019s look at some examples,\n- She showed great patience despite the continual delays.\n- Her father was very patient as she asked him nonstop questions.\n- Be patient, there is someone out there for you too.\nWhat makes patience tricky is that its adjective form \u201cpatient\u201d is a homonym.

Any attempt to encapsulate his work in single instrument is a daunting task.\nNevertheless, \"Picasso: the man, his works, the legend\" does an excellent job of providing extensive information on Picasso's career without burying the viewer under a mountain of data.\nThe CD-ROM uses two categories for looking at Picasso's work: \"Notebook\" and \"Themes\". \"Notebook\" provides a chronological arrangement of the material in the form of a horizontally scrolling virtual gallery. Picasso's career is divided into seventeen historical sections, each identified by a typical work of that period. Within each of these sections are subsections that provide biographical and social background, as well as detailed discussion of a variety of works created in that period. There is a wealth of material that branches off from these subsections, allowing the viewer much freedom to digress from the primary narrative. But the effective navigational interface allows simple and direct return to the main road. The \"Themes\" path divides the works into categories such as \"Portraits\", \"Sculpture\", etc. and is an engaging alternative to the chronological approach.\nOne hundred images are given the full treatment, with scrollable zoom and an even closer static view, an informative scale comparison with", "Have I gone crazy as I just told you all how to mix in stereo and create stereo where there was none?

(See our full page here for a more in depth explanation of these homonyms/homophones.)\nWhen to Use Patients\nPatients is the plural form of patient and, in this sense, is defined as, \u201ca person receiving or schedule to receive medical treatment.\u201d For example,\n- The doctor is very busy with a booked schedule of patients.\n- The patients at the hospital are in need or care.\nAs I said above, \u201cpatient\u201d can sometimes be tricky because it has two different meanings. A good way to keep them apart in your mind is that \u201cpatient\u201d as a character trait, i.e., adjective, cannot have an \u201cs\u201d after it. Only the sense of \u201cpatient\u201d that refers to humans can have an \u201cs\u201d after it.\nRemember the Difference\nAside from what was just mentioned, there is another good way to keep patients vs. patience apart in your mind.\nPatience is a character trait. Both of these words have \u201cc\u2019s\u201d in them.\nPatients, on the other hand, refers to people. A patient to a doctor is very similar to what a lawyer might call a client. Both of these words refer to people, and they both end in \u201cient.\u201d\nDo I use patience or patients? Well, of course, that depends. While these words all sound the same and, in some cases are spelled the same, it\u2019s important to use patients vs. patience properly in our writing to maintain clarity.\nPatience is a noun and is a human character trait.

Many children seek their parents' beds at bedtime.\n-- Fears, worries and anxiety: Most commonly involves an increase in specific fears involving situations or cues resembling the traumatic event. Children experience increased anxiety to being away from parents or caregivers or from an inability to remember aspects of the event. Fears can be related or unrelated to the event, including worries about bugs, dogs or going to new places. Children may also worry about losses -- both tangible items and loss of routine or the ability to play with friends or celebrate birthdays as before.\n-- Avoidance: Actively avoiding things and activities that remind children of the traumatic event, including magical thinking that links clothing worn or games played at the time of the trauma.\n-- Numbing: A desire to be left alone, not wanting to play as much, or expressing a lack of interest in things that held their attention before the event. May also include blunted emotions, including fewer smiles, less response to parental love, or decreased anger or sadness.\n-- Clingy behavior: Intense reluctance to return to school or have parents out of sight.\n-- Arousal: Increased irritability, extreme vigilance, jumpiness and difficulty concentrating.\n-- Mood changes: Temper tantrums over extremely minor events, stubbornness, disagreements with friends, increased defiance, diminished school performance.\n-- Somatic complaints: Headaches, stomachaches, nausea, and vague feelings of aches, pains and sickness.\n-- Regressive behaviors: Loss of previously acquired skills, including using the toilet, returning to a bottle or pacifier, language skills and the need for parents and teachers to provide extra help with feeding, hand washing and dressing.\n-- Hurtful talk or play: Expressions of strong wishes for revenge, intensely negative and hurtful ideas about individuals or groups of people -- possibly incorporated in more aggressive or destructive play.\nSource: \"Healing After Trauma Skills; A Manual for Professionals, Teachers, and Families Working with Children After Disasters\" by Robin H.

MC Devvo\u2019s language from 10 years ago is no worse. And yet Webb has lost his job. It seems that, according to our educational gatekeepers, someone can only be a suitable teacher if he or she has a mind as innocent and as squeaky-clean as the schoolchildren. Unless your inner life is as uncomplicated as Peppa Pig\u2019s, you are a figure of suspicion.\nIn the past, a number of great artists, writers and comedians also worked as teachers, creating material outside of the classroom that was not suitable for children. Stephen King, Gene Simmons, Anthony Burgess, Kurt Vonnegut and DH Lawrence all wrote or performed adult material while they were teachers. More recently, sweary comedian Romesh Ranganathan started his comedy career when he was still a maths teacher. They were all left alone to craft and create. Society did not feel the need to uncover their lives outside of school, and they were trusted not to bring them into the classroom.\nMy hunch is that Webb most likely brought a performer\u2019s wit and creative flair to the classroom. Indeed, while some of the parents in the Sun\u2019 report agree with Webb\u2019s sacking, others acknowledge that he had a \u2018good reputation\u2019. One says that \u2018everyone always said he was a brilliant teacher\u2019.\nSchools are crying out for good teachers. Creativity, a sense of humour, chutzpah, a sharp observational eye, the ability to portray larger-than-life characters\u2026 these are all wonderful qualities for a teacher. With his Devvo character, Christian Webb has shown he has all of these.\nA wise headteacher would hold on to him, rather than stick him on the dole queue.\nGareth Sturdy teaches mathematics and English in London and is co-organiser of the Academy of Ideas Education Forum.\nPicture by: YouTube.\nTo enquire about republishing spiked\u2019s content, a right to reply or to request a correction, please contact the managing editor, Viv Regan.", "How are children who survived or lost siblings in the Sandy Hook shooting affected by the trauma, according to experts", "bling in a dryer.

With Tesla and other tech companies pushing towards new approaches to rooftop solar, the roofing giant put its foot in the game to \u201cdisrupt the roofing industry\u201d before someone else does.\nAccording to DeBono, GAF Energy\u2019s edge comes from approaching the shingles from the perspective of a roofing company, rather than a solar company. Their emphasis on the product\u2019s utility as a roofing material can help rooftop solar move away from the (relatively) clunky panels we\u2019ve come to know and love.\nCustomer acquisition is typically costly for solar businesses, but because GAF Energy is already embedded in the roofing industry, it\u2019s in a good position to solarize the roofing market, a quarter of which GAF already commands, Canary Media says.\nThe 45-watt shingles take one to th", "What is the difference between 'patients' and 'patience' as explained in the text", "ould that be fun?\nIt was for one player.

Christian Webb was sacked last December from his teaching job at a primary school in Doncaster. His bosses had discovered his involvement in a number of viral comedy rap videos in the mid-2000s. It emerged last week that this was the reason for his dismissal.\nBack in 2005, Webb and internet filmmaker David Firth created a comedy character called Darren Devonshire, aka MC Devvo. A self-styled \u2018dole-queue hero\u2019, Devvo (played by Webb) satirised the music scene of Doncaster\u2019s white working class. Devvo is \u2018a pill-munching, northern scallie\u2019, in the words of one Vice writer, with foul-mouthed tunes like \u2018Donny Soldier\u2019, \u2018Chrystal Meffin\u2019 and \u2018Yorkshire Till I Die\u2019. The songs are full of four-letter words and references to drugs and sex. The satirical schtick is similar to Nottingham\u2019s MC Pitman and Newport\u2019s Goldie Lookin\u2019 Chain. This is humour for grown-ups poking fun at the bleak conditions of Britain\u2019s left-behind towns.\nThe Devvo character reached its peak in popularity a decade ago, and was officially retired in 2016. Webb has been a primary-school teacher since 2008. According to the Sun, both his colleagues at King Edward Primary School and local parents were unaware of the videos until he was sacked.\nOver the years, Webb has had viral successes beyond MC Devvo. He is also credited with co-creating \u2013 also with David Firth \u2013 the dark viral sensation \u2018Salad Fingers\u2019. These achievements should be celebrated, not treated as sackable offences. Sadly, in the nervous, safeguarding-obsessed culture of today\u2019s schools, Webb\u2019s coarse but harmless comedy from many years ago is apparently to be treated as a threat to children\u2019s safety.\nWhen grime superstar Stormzy is invited to give talks in schools, it is on the assumption that he won\u2019t rap swe", "Who are some of the notable guests and artists mentioned for the ComiCONN event", "What concerns does the speaker identify regarding their health issues and medication accessibility", "What type of USB ethernet adapter is currently supported according to the text", "What is Stashbee\u2019s mission in the context of the sharing economy", "CNBC saying this!\n- Getting ready to post its fifth straight apocalyptic predictions for the coming century, prediction which like the last four will no doubt all be falsified by global temperatures, the UN\u2019s IPCC says it\u2019s not going less of for science and more for politics.
