We spent a full week at Russell House receiving respite care and making memories which will last a lifetime.\nOn the first day we stayed over all of our direct family came to the hospice to meet Shalome and they too fell in love both with Shalome and the place after being taken aback by the fantastic facilities on hand.\nThroughout the week we did a number of memory-making activities including foot painting and clay prints, we wrote a lullaby with the support of the music therapist, received complementary therapy and were cooked for every day. Knowing we were in safe hands really did come as a huge relief to us all and we are so thankful for the support.\nIf we had remained in the hospital, Shalome would likely have been taken away for more and more tests, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay together through the night and the chance for family members to properly bond with Shalome just wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\nMore recently we have attended a parents\u2019 coffee morning at Russell House as well as the family Christmas party; two great events which gave us the opportunity to meet other families in similar positions to us but also giving us a chance to once again relax and have a bit of fun.\nThe support from Forget Me Not Children\u2019s Hospice really does mean the world to us, it is irreplaceable. Having 24-hour access to the care team, knowing we can pick up the phone at any time day or night and knowing a helping voice will be there is amazing.\nIt\u2019s not 999, it\u2019s not intensive, it\u2019s palliative and it is exactly how we want it.\nForget Me Not Children\u2019s Hospice cares for families who have a child with a lifeshortening condition, and is currently caring for more than 100 children and families.

Head Injuries - Head Injury Lawyer Fairview Heights, IL Unlike someone with a broken arm, a person diagnosed with a head injury often shows no outward appearance of being injured. Brain injuries, however, can have lasting consequences whereas broken bones can heal. Those who are suffering from brain injuries aren't always aware that their functions are being impaired. So what are the common types of head injuries, and what are the symptoms associated with that injury? Our Personal Injury Lawyers in Fairview Heights have taken on and successfully fought head injuries in a wide variety of claims, and the head injuries they litigate most commonly are as follows: Concussions - This type of head injury is common in most sports as well as accidents. Any force that causes the head to move in a whiplash-like motion, or any direct force that knocks into the skull can cause the brain to violently impact the inside of the skull. Signs of a concussion are loss of consciousness, disrupted vision, and loss of balance/awareness. Fractures - This happens when the skull breaks under force. Because of the force required to break the skull bone, these injuries are typically more life-threatening. In most cases, severe brain damage does occur. Linear Skull Fractures - This is the most common type of skull fracture. There is a break in the bone structure of the skull, but the broken bone does not move anywhere. Typically, little intervention is needed to correct this injury. Depressed Skull Fractures - In this case, the brain can be damaged by the bone and force of the accident. Surgery is typically required for this level of injury. Hematomas - This injury is caused by blood clots on or around the brain which causes the brain to undergo pressure. Epidural Hematoma - This hematoma forms between the skull and the dura that protects the brain. This injury is caused by broken or ruptured blood vessels in the brain. In this injury, migraines are very common, as well as loss of consciousness or motor functions. Contusion - This type of hematoma is a direct injury to the brain, rather than an outside injury that affects it. Symptoms include bruising, swelling of the brain, loss of consciousness, loss of motor functions and more. Head Injuries should always be taken seriously, get you or your loved one medical ca", "rain-friendly imagery than positives. Work to develop a positive explanatory style.\n6. Keep Control of Your Attitude\nThe general energy you give off is one of the first unconscious things people respond to. If you\u2019re frazzled, project calm. If you\u2019re distracted and unenthusiastic, project positivity. (You\u2019ll not only make a better impression, but you can influence your own mood.)\n7. Manage Your Moods\nPeople are drawn to warmth, enthusiasm, and confidence more than anger, arrogance, and impatience. Whatever is going on around you, manage your responses to get the best response from others.\nMake sure your words, your tone of voice, and your body language are all saying the same thing. Mixed messages put off others, but consistency gives you clarity and credibility.\n9. Use Sensory Language\nActivate people\u2019s senses, and mix up your imagery to make sure you hit their strength. Whenever possible, use descriptions of visual images, sounds, textures, motion, and feelings to add meaning to what you\u2019re saying.\n10. Be Curious, Open-Minded, and Interested\nIf you can get the other person talking and keep them talking, odds are they\u2019ll be drawn to you. Be interested and open-minded; ask questions that spark their imagination and ignite conversation.\n11. Dress for Success\nFind a personal style that represents who you are and the message you want to send about yourself. Look at your dress and appearance as packaging a product.\n12. Have a Personal Statement\nHave a personal statement prepared and memorized so you can tell others concisely and eloquently what you do, what it means to you, and why it makes a difference. Think of it not as a sales pitch, but as an engaging and artfully crafted mini-presentation.\nWork through these points and you should have a great first impression all lined up.\n13.

(No pressure, right?)\nSo, whether you are looking to raise money for your company, or you are managing your team or leading your business, connecting to people and making a great impression is very important.\nHere are some tips to help you win hearts and minds in 30 seconds:\n1. Neutralize the Fight-or-Flight Response\nThe first few seconds of a first encounter are driven by instinctive reactions. Each person makes unconscious immediate appraisals that center around how safe they feel. Be mindful of your immediate signals, and make sure they could never be perceived as threatening.\n2. Respect Boundaries\nBe mindful of personal space and respect the boundaries of others. If in doubt, follow the other person\u2019s cues: If they lean in, you lean in; if they stand back, you do the same. Remember that concepts of appropriate personal space vary by culture.\n3. Feed Expectations\nIn business, first impressions are frequently colored by expectations. We expect people to live up to the image we have created in our minds from their reputation, phone calls, emails, or texts. We expect consistency with that general image\u2014and without it, we feel some degree of disappointment and confusion.

The CYP2D6 gene has several variant forms that are associated with no activity or reduced activity compared to the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"normal\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" version of the gene. While genetic testing for CYP2D6 is becoming more accessible, guiding drug therapy with genetic information alone may not be sufficient in children as the genotype-phenotype relationship may be influenced by developmental changes that occur between birth and adolescence. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the relative roles of ontogeny and genetic variation in the observed variability in CYP2D6 activity in school- aged children and adolescents, and to assess the functional consequences of the observed variability. To achieve these goals, a total of 180 children and adolescents from 6 to 15 years of age, consisting of patients with a primary diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;n=60) and age- and sex-matched controls (n=120), will have their CYP2D6 activity measured every 6 months for 3 years (Aim 1). The activity measurement will utilize the over- the-counter cough suppressant, dextromethorphan or \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"DM\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\", a standard probe for determining CYP2D6 phenotype. The procedure involves administering a 0.5 mg/kg dose of DM and collecting urine over the following four hours. CYP2D6 activity or \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"metabolizer\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" status is assigned based on the relative amounts of DM and the metabolite produced by CYP2D6, dextrorphan (DX), present in the urine sample.\nAim 2 will test the hypothesis that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers can be distinguished from extensive metabolizers based on a metabolomic biomarker pattern present in urine samples collected for Aim 1. In the study for Aim 3, the DM to be used will contain a stable isotope of carbon ([13C]) to determine if a rapid, office-based assessment of CYP2D6 is feasible. The principle of this test is that the [13C]-methyl group released by CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation of [13C]-dextromethorphan appears in expired air as [13C]O2, referred to as a 'breath test'. Finally, the functional consequences of CYP2D6 activity (Aim 4) will be assessed by comparing the systemic exposure to the non-stimulant drug atomoxetine (Strattera(R)) in two groups of ADHD extensive metabolizers drawn from the highest and lowest 20th percentiles of the breath test data distribution. Ultimately, the goal of the research is to personalize the use of medications in children by selecting the appropriate dose of the correct medication for individual patients.\nCytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an important enzyme in the body for breaking down many medica", "The federal government of Nigeria has lined up series of activities to express gratitude to the female national team, Super Falcons, over their ninth conquest of the Africa Women Cup of Nations.\nFootballlive.ng can report that a hint about a forthcoming line of celebration programmes for the Falcons was revealed by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s chief of staff, Alhaji Abba Kyari, while receiving the team on arrival back home in Nigeria.\nKyari, who was at the head of a delegation of prominent personalities, businessmen and officials of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) that received the Falcons on arrival in Abuja on Sunday evening, said the ladies have made Preside", "What core principles does NV London Calcutta focus on in their business practices", "What is the address and contact information provided in the text segment", "Hey Guys, MiaT is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

The advantages tend to be very functional ones, and ones that are designed to save you time and make life easier.\nThe main advantage is the flexibility and convenience of wireless. Its very quick and easy to establish a wireless connection, you can do so from a range of devices and a range of different types of wireless access points.\nThe disadvantages of wireless tend to focus around security and stability. No matter how secure the wireless connection may be, it does add another element that makes it open to potential attack in a broader sense than that of a hard wired connection. Due to the nature of wireless connections, they are often less stable than wired connections.\nWhen to use wireless and when to use hard wired\nBecause of the advantages and disadvantages of wireless Internet there are situations that tend to prefer each type fo connection. Wireless connections are preferable when you are not doing anything that requires a high level of security and also when you are performing tasks that do not require a high level of stability in terms of the Internet connection. Good examples would be browsing the Internet for research, checking personal emails and so on.\nWired Internet is preferable when you are carrying out tasks that require high levels of security and also when you are performing tasks that require a great level of stability.

But the couple agreed the baby was wanted, come what may, and Emma gave birth to daughter Shalome, a name which means \u2018peace.\u2019 They will face difficulties during Shalome\u2019s limited lifespan, but they have the support of Forget Me Not Children\u2019s Hospice in Huddersfield. Emma tells her story\u2026\nWhen we went for Shalome\u2019s 20-week scan, the doctors told us that she had severe brain abnormalities and her life was likely to be incompatible outside the womb. When you receive that kind of news you\u2019re unsure what to do and really where to turn to.\nA week later we went back for a second scan and were told there was more brain activity apparent, meaning Shalome could potentially survive, but even if she did she may be in a vegetative state and live until she was nine or ten years old.\nShortly after this, we moved from Birmingham to Huddersfield. We were just leaving the hospital after another of our appointments when a screening nurse came running down the corridor telling us to get in touch with Forget Me Not Children\u2019s Hospice.\nBefore we had chance to contact them, Emma Bleasdale (neonatal care coordinator) gave us a call and we booked in for a visit to Russell House.\nIt was a Saturday morning in September when we arrived at Russell House and after being shown all of the facilities and meeting the staff we were overwhelmed. The whole place was absolutely fantastic.\nThe visit really gave us hope and something positive to look forward to in a period of our lives where every single medical experience that we had was just bad news; we had got the spring back in our step and we were finally able to look forward to the rest of the pregnancy with excitement.\nThe input of Forget Me Not prior to Shalome\u2019s birth really made a huge difference to our lives.

To achieve that objective a mixed methods approach is used, where MCA and qualitative analysis complement each other by gathering information about different aspects of the MPIs and their implications for the governance and future policies. The research design is structured towards three more specific objectives, each being associated with a methodological step, as follows:\nStep 1. To investigate the MPIs that need to be improved to ensure proper functioning. This objective is achieved via a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) of selected MPIs, based on performance and relevance criteria (Effectiveness, Undesired effects, Targeting, Efficiency, Feasibility, Urgency and priority) selected via EU stakeholder consultation;\nStep 2. To identify changes in the design of the MPIs, owing to 8 categories (Income and market support, Agri-environment payments, Payments for investments, Knowledge promotion, Certification schemes, Food policies, Networking/cooperation, Other measures), to increase their performances. This objective is achieved via a qualitative analysis;\nStep 3. To explore how future policies can facilitate governance adjustments and opportunities for the correct implementation of the mix of MPIs. This objective is achieved via a qualitative analysis.\nData for all methodological steps are collected at the case study (CS)-level via workshops and/or interviews from the same set of stakeholders, using guidelines prepared by CREA. Result interpretation creates a link with Deliverable 3.4 (Schwarz et al., 2021) by referring to the different transition stages observed in the case studies (Initiating and Enhancing) and to the barriers that the MPIs aim at removing.\nPerformance and relevance rankings share the top three MPIs, i.e. Knowledge promotion, Networking / Cooperation and Payments for investments. When considering Initiating vs Enhancing case studies, Knowledge promotion is considered the backbone of the MPIs mix for both CS groups; instead there is trade-off in the relevance and performance ranking of Networking/cooperation MPIs, with Enhancing displaying greater figures. A possible reason for this difference is the greater need for aggregation, peer-to-peer discussion, and integration of several different actors in CS at the Enhancing stage, compared with those at the Initiating stage, as the knowledge challenge has shifted from knowledge creation and diffusion (Initiating) to capacity building (Enhancing).\nThe different transition stage might support the understanding of the better ranking of Knowledge promotion, Payments for investments, Agri-environment payments, and Certification schemes in the Initiating than in the Enhancing CSs. Those MPIs can trigger a transformation process of those farming systems that are still based on conventional, resource use efficiency or input-substitution production methods. Income and market support MPIs are considered not essential or moderately essential to initiate or enhance the adoption of AEPs. This looks reasonable when considering substantially economic objective of these MPIs and the concern of farmers at the Enhancing stage not to jeopardize the survival of the farms due to lack of recognition by the market for the efforts made to transform their farming system.

Following a written application process, students selected will demonstrate an interest in understanding the School\u2019s range of ICT (Information & Communications Technology) programs as well as a capacity to be part of the whole school ICT student leadership team and the combined Staff/Student ICT Committee.\nThe student IT leader positions are for one year with annual appointments or re-appointments by the Deputy Headmaster and the teaching staff involved in IT areas. Each IT leader will have his own portfolio, but will work together as the student IT team in each sub-school to manage initiatives and projects. The team members will be expected to provide feedback to the staff about any management issues or technical problems. Some lunchtime meetings will be involved.\nA Prefect role assists in the co-ordination of the student IT leader positions and the Student ICT Committee is chaired by a Captain.

Brown acknowledged that the volatility is an issue, but again turned to history to make his case.\n\u201cI like to compare the way it was to the way it is,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe way it was \u2014 when I was governor the first time \u2014 the top 1 percent, 1.5 percent, the top income earners garnered about 8 percent of the collective income of California. Now they take in 22 percent. So you go from 8 to 22. Anyone below that is contributing to their enhanced well being. \u2026 So then to ask those who have been most blessed and most fortunate to give back one or two or three percent, from an equity point of view, from a fairness point of view, I\u2019ll even say from a Christian point of view, is perfectly appropriate. From a volatility point of view, yeah the up and down is not what I would like it to, but then what could we do. We couldn\u2019t have a tax then.

Old cars, horse carts, clothes, furniture and things from 150 years ago kept safe and preserved. Original buildings, train tracks, houses and then of course that vault with the real diamonds. It is absolutely stunning. Unfortunately we were not allowed to take any photos of the real diamonds. All the facilities were clean and they have a little restaurant inside the main building.\nIt was extremely hot so we finished our day with a nice meal and ice cream.

While leadership is not explicitly taught as a separate topic at Hutchins, we do educate our students to be mindful citizens who are willing to take up opportunities and to learn from both the experience itself and those individuals with whom they have worked.\nTaking on such opportunities sees support, guidance and counsel offered by the staff mentor of that activity and provides an amazing opportunity for our young men to learn about themselves, their strengths and their weaknesses and to grow from the experience. At any stage in their schooling students may develop skills and confidences that contribute to their willingness to be involved as leaders.\nLeadership opportunities are available to all boys. Whilst not all boys seek to lead others, it is our belief that all boys are first and foremost leaders of self and this philosophy underpins many of the expectations we place on all boys with regard to their commitments, interactions, behaviour and appearance. Leadership is therefore inculcated as part of the development of leadership of oneself and then of others.\nWe support the notion of service leadership and place great emphasis on giving back to the School, the broader community and being participative in how we serve the needs of others. This involvement within the School is varied and could be, for example, through coaching a younger sports or debating team, giving private tuition to a musician or assisting someone with their academics. It could be boys involving themselves on committees to assist with the organisation and running of specific events either within the House or for the whole school. Within the broader community, examples include our strong working relationship with the nearby Queenborough Rise Nursing Home, our ongoing blood drive with the Red Cross and the hundreds of man hours our boys provided assisting those farmers effected by bushfires in the Derwent Valley.\nFor those who formally seek to take on positions of leadership, a number of opportunities or paths are available. This can occur through the captaincy or leadership within a co-curricular activity or through the Junior School Council, Middle School Council, Student IT Committee, Student Representative Council (Years 9\u201311), House Executives (Years 9\u201312) or Prefect body.\nFollowing a written application process and interview, boys and staff vote for those boys they believe will best represent the virtues of a Hutchins Prefect.

When I planned this trip I was in full school mom mode and decided to make it an educational trip for the kids. Always fun but something new to learn every day. So I decided we\u2019d go from the Free State to Cape Town on a Northern Cape road trip adventure.\nOur first stop was Kimberley. We arrived just after lunch and it was an easy drive, about two and a half hours. We checked into our accommodation, unhooked the trailer and went straight to The Big Hole, Kimberley.\nI\u2019ve been there before but as a kid, I don\u2019t know maybe 25 years ago. Google maps confused me a little, it must have taken me to an old entrance, but we found the parking area eventually.\nMy oldest child loved it, the history was her favorite part. We paid for the full tour and it was super nice. We left a couple of days before school closed for the holidays so it wasn\u2019t busy with thousands of tourists. I prefer it like that, easier to keep my eyes on four heads.\nThe actual hole is massive. It really looks small on the pictures. I don\u2019t remember it being this big! The Big Hole is definitely something to see, it\u2019s hard to believe they dug it with their bare hands, hand made shovels and picks without any modern machinery or yellow metal.\nBefore the tour started they showed us a short movie on where and when it all started. The first diamond was found on the banks of the Orange river by a small child. He played with the rock which looked like old glass. His mom gave it away for free, she had no idea what her child had. The man she gave it to offered her money for the rock but she said he could have it for free.\nKimberley Mining History\nThey started digging for diamonds in Colesberg before they started in Kimberley and apparently the Kimberley hole is or rather was a copy of Colesberg.

This suggests the existence of a systemic vision in addressing the problem of knowledge promotion, ranging from changes on the design of dedicated instruments to promote knowledge diffusion to changes on the design of regulatory restrictions and incentives to raise awareness among final recipients (farmers).\nCAP Pillar II instruments, especially knowledge promotion, cooperation and agri-environment payments, are evaluated as the most effective for encouraging the AE transition. This is especially relevant for farms that are initiating the adoption of AEPs and that need to face the challenge of knowledge creation. Food policies and certification schemes play a pivotal role by allowing the diffusion of AEPs - especially when the transition is initiating - and the related knowledge. Networking/cooperation instruments are crucial to create synergies within and amongst food chains and to support consumer responsibilities and involvement, which are needed to address the capacity building challenge and enhance AEPs towards system redesign.\nTo support the removal of the knowledge and social capital barriers, future policy should sustain the access to advisory services by farmers, to raise awareness about agro-ecological practices. With agricultural diversification being a core theme in agro-ecology, the creation of partnerships and collective projects is a key step towards the increased availability of agro-ecological food on the local markets. Then, there is a need for targeted interventions for intermediate institutions (e.g., rural districts) and for the empowerment of the cooperation measures of the Rural Development Programme (e.g., pilot food chain projects).\nTo remove the value added and market access barriers, consumer markets should be more sustainable. Future policies can support sustainable market development through various instruments. For example, new voluntary \u201cagro-ecology\u201d certification and labelling schemes may be required in the short term. Public procurement initiatives are an additional way to drive the agro-ecological transition from the demand-side. These can build on already existing programmes (e.g. school programmes), but to improve public procurement initiatives, new and more ambitious standards are required in the call for tenders for public schools (e.g., local food, reducing food waste).\nTo remove the policy design barriers, there is a need for lighter bureaucracy and for a simplification in the requirements for policy support. Further experimenting innovative MPIs like result-based payments and eco-schemes targeted to AE practices might speed-up the AE transition process in Europe, as well.\nUNISECO is a European research project aiming to develop innovative approaches to enhance the understanding of socio-economic and policy drivers and barriers for further development and implementation of agro-ecological practices in EU farming systems.

Once you change something, it\u2019s hard to go back.\nOne big area of concern is that a center section of roof paneling needs to be replaced, and I\u2019m concerned with getting it to match.\nThe other tricky part is the flooring. We want to go with a vinyl flooring which most readily comes in a hardwood or stone look. With the original paneling, that\u2019s a lot of wood in a small, round space.\nI think I\u2019ve almost landed at a decision, and I want your thoughts on it.\nWhat I think I\u2019ll do is replace the damaged roof section with additional paneling and maybe a patterned paper or paint in that section if I can\u2019t get a true match. I\u2019m leaning towards a white subway tile flooring to brighten it up, and then paint just the cabinets in the kitchen area to help tie it all together.\nWhat do you think?

It had been a long while since the sun was shining and Dianne wanted to take advantage of the sunshine.\n\u201cIt sure is a nice day,\u201d said an older man that sat down on the bench beside Dianne, while she gave Baby Troll his bottle.\n\u201cYes it is,\u201d said Dianne. \u201cIt seems that sunny days are few and far between these days.\u201d\n\u201cIt definitely does,\u201d said the older man. \u201cThis winter has been a very tough one.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Dianne, sensing that the older man was talking about more than the weather.\n\u201cI lost my wife, Rosie,\u201d said the older man, a tear forming in the corner of his eyes.\n\u201cOh I am so sorry,\u201d said Dianne. \u201cLosing a loved one is never a good thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d said the older man. \u201cLosing my Rosie to my best friend, Pete, was the hardest thing I have gone through.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d said Dianne. \u201cYou mean Rosie is still alive.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the older man. \u201cShe\u2019s still alive. Oh, wait, when I said I lost her you thought I meant\u2026 Oh dear, yes, she is still alive.\u201d\n\u201cWell then, \u201csaid Dianne. \u201cThen what are you waiting for. You still have a chance to get her back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Pete?\u201d said the older man.\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d said Dianne. \u201cHe can\u2019t be that nice of a friend if he stole Rosie away from you.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said the older man.\n\u201cWell then,\u201d said Dianne. \u201cIt is up to you to get Rosie back, that is if you want her back. You can\u2019t give up hope.\u201d\n\u201cOh, more than anything in this world,\u201d said the older man, tears streaming down his face.\nDianne sat and talked with the older man for about half an hour. The learned that his name was Hank and that he and Rosie were married for over forty years. Dianne also found out the she knew who Rosie was. Rosie worked in the Troll Town Diner as a waitress.\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Dianne. \u201cValentine\u2019s Day is tomorrow. Meet me at the diner at noon and wear your best suit. You\u2019re going to get your Rosie back.\u201d\nDianne didn\u2019t tell Hank that she had actually talked to Rosie in the diner, several times. Rosie had told Dianne that she left Hank because she thought that Hank didn\u2019t love her anymore. Rosie told Dianne that she has been waiting for Hank to come and fight for her and win her love. She also told Dianne her and Pete were just friends and that P", "Gov. Jerry Brown sat down with the San Jose Mercury News editorial board today to discuss his ballot proposition to raise taxes for education. If the measure fails, automatic trigger cuts will mean billions cut from K-12, community colleges and public universities in California.\nBrown started off with some political history \u2014 a little bit of \u2018how did we get into this mess \u2014 for the assembled Mercury News reporters and editors.\n\u201cIf you go back to Pete Wilson,\u201d Brown began, \u201cwe had a big recession, he had to cut massively and raise taxes massively. And then Davis rode up the high tech bubble and rode it down. That created its own problems and then Arnold came in and he rode the mortgage bubble up and also rode it down. And so that we are caught in waves of prosperity and misfortune. And in that process, the problem has been compounded because the Democrats and Republicans as they try to negotiate a balance, the Democrats want to get some more benefits and the Republicans counter with tax breaks. That then compounds the problem, because you have more spending and less revenue.\u201d\nWhich brings us to the present and a $16 billion budget shortfall Brown had to balance, just this year. He came up with Prop. 30 which raises taxes on people earning more than $250,000 each year and raises the sales tax by .25 percent. The income tax expires in seven years, and the sales tax lasts four years.\nBrown believes a tax was the only way to close the budget hole.\n\u201cInstead of the tax, we could have cut, but we\u2019ve already cut a huge amount,\u201d the governor insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve cut 25 percent from higher education. We\u2019re cutting our prisons back, substantially, 30-40,000 people who used to go to prison aren\u2019t going there any more. We cut the money that you give the pensions for blind, the disabled, and the aged \u2014 from $850 a month to $835 \u2014 cut 15 bucks from some of the poorest people. \u2026 If", "What responsibilities do Prefects have in relation to their role within the school community", "What are the characteristics and benefits of planting Little Bluestem according to the text", "What are the proposed dependency cuts mentioned by the governor if his proposition does not pass", "What is the goal of the research proposal regarding CYP2D6 activity in children and adolescents", "What types of worksheets are mentioned in the text segment"]}
