Because the show brings together very early and very late work from the British artist\u2019s career, we have selected one old excerpt, by Lawrence Alloway, and one new sample, by William Feaver, who in 2014 wrote an essay following Caro\u2019s death the year before. Both excerpts follow below.\n\u201cArt news from London\u201d\nBy Lawrence Alloway\nThe \u201cgeometry of fear\u201d phase of British postwar sculpture is over. The linearism of the 1940s and early \u201950s is rarely seen now. Iron has declined in popularity and traditional materials are back in use. This has returned mass to sculpture. Kenneth Armitage spoke for a number of the younger sculptors when he commented on a visit to Calder Hall, Britain\u2019s atomic power station: \u201cA living L\u00e9ger perhaps, but the excessively immaculate and organized space made me long for some dirt and untidiness.\u201d \u201cThere was comfort,\u201d he added, \u201cin thinking that even here there must be a lavatory: or that somewhere, surely, a misguided spider might be laying her eggs.\u201d\nA generalization about current British sculpture must include: solidity, traditional materials, room for spider\u2019s eggs and a dislike of highly abstracted forms. There are exceptions, of course: Robert Adams, for example, reveals a renewed interest in Gonzalez and the now-popular Lynn Chadwick is, on the whole, outside this tendency towards non-geometric images. His metal forms, punning on the resemblance of mechanical and organic life, seem humanoids of the 1940s rather than new faces. Two sculptors who typify the present tendency (both were born in 1924 and both show at Gimpel) are Anthony Caro and Hubert Dalwood.\nWith dollops of matter and unbendable projections, Caro builds up burly nudes and massive busts. The new thickness has deceived some critics. As the sculpture is not linear and as the human image is overwhelmingly insisted on, they have tried to read the figures in terms of Renaissance mechanics. Thus a pregnant woman of Caro\u2019s was said to carry herself without a due regard to the baby\u2019s weight. What Caro dramatizes is the emergence of human beings out of raw material.

Both of these \u2018innovations\u2019 illustrate clearly our human desire to fix what doesn\u2019t necessarily need fixing, manipulate what doesn\u2019t suit us, and take control over what is mysterious and seems uncontrollable. They also show how easily we take something that could be beneficial and quickly we get carried away with our desire to control what may not be intended by nature and God to be under our power.\n1. Blind Disregard to Nature\u2019s Infinite Sophistication\nNature has a sense to it, cultivated over billions of years of evolution. The complexity of botanical systems, the relationship to pests, soil, and the elements sustains optimal diversity and reproduction. It was only when we began to industrialize the process, hijack growth with an eye toward yield, and allow chemical companies to attempt to regulate variables of perceived adversity that we ended up in the mess that GMO crops are in today. Now we have randomly spliced animal DNA with bacterial vectors inserting into plant genomes, disrupting the natural functioning of the plant, and allowing for supersaturation with the toxic, endocrine-disrupting and gut bug slaughtering herbicide, Roundup.\nPharmaceutical companies and doctors think they can outsmart immune systems that have evolved to coexist with microbes, to be primed and educated by them. We are at war with infectious disease, and as a consequence, our fear and malice toward bacteria and viruses have lead us to compromise and alter our immune systems with pathogens entering our bodies through our muscles, accompanied by toxic additives that cripple our natural immune function and cause chronic inflammation. The notion of improving upon our human capacities, as we understand them is discussed by Sayer Ji of GreenMedInfo as \u201ctranshumanism.\u201d\n2. Lack of Safety Research Prior to Mass Distribution\nMonsanto claims that GMOs are simultaneously equivalent to existing foods (relieving them of any real duty to demonstrate safety), and novel enough that they can be patented. Despite the Frankensteinian effects of genetic manipulation on proteins and gene expression, these foods have never been studied in a human population, let alone assessing for long-term effects. What happens as a result of this fast-track-to-market process is that slow-emerging trends of harm at the population level begin to emerge. Differing patterns of chronic disease in Europe and America at this point may have some relation to limitations of GMO products in Europe. There is inherent difficulty in associating cause to effect in chronic disease; however, arguing for the importance of long-term premarketing trials.\nVaccines have similarly, never been studied against an unvaccinated control group, allegedly because they are assumed to be so vital to our health that it would be unethical to withhold them even though basic epidemiology demonstrates that hygiene and nutrition have played the most significant role in elimination of infectious disease. They have never been studied in their current schedule, nor have the additives (adjuvants) which include known body toxins, aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, and polysorbate 80.\nVaccines and GMOs continue to be linked to a plethora of illnesses and ailments through a variety of third-party scientific institutions and independent researchers, many contradicting studies funded by Big Pharma and Biotech that seem to find no reason for concern.\nDespite this lack of effort and incentive to support safety data in these two arenas, both have suffered a signal of harm that should have activated the precautionary principal. Monsanto monitored GM and non-GM fed rats for 90 days, and declared that changes in liver and kidney function were not clinically significant.

As a born-again Cubist in the ways he treated his materials\u2014clamping them, abutting them, clustering them\u2014he upheld the philosophy of synthesis: that untiring appetite for the reconciliation of disparate parts into congruent wholes.\nHis Cubism was businesslike. From Early One Morning onward, his career was geared toward the occupation of spaces, from closest indoors to greatest outdoors. He worked on such a scale that, relishing opportunities, he could locate processional quantities of his Greco-Romanesque Cubism on Park Avenue and in the Tuileries\u2014not so much for his own satisfaction as in the belief that such grand temporary implants could do wonders for the cause of modern sculpture.

This is the most enlightening exploration of its toxic mechanisms. Bt-toxin in GMO corn has been found to puncture intestinal cells and circulate into fetal tissue.\nWhether in the realm of neurodevelopment, death, autoimmunity, or even susceptibility to the disease intended to provide protection from, vaccines have been demonstrated to harm and several billion dollars of taxpayer money have been paid out to victims through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

Suppression of Conflicting Information in the Mainstream\nSeralini was silenced. His work was roundly attacked, censored from the media, and demands from industry ties for the paper to be retracted from its journal of publication. Several months after Seralini\u2019s paper, Richard Goodman, a former Monsanto employee was fast-tracked to the position of Associate Editor for Biotechnology. With Monsanto now at the helm of influential medical journals, the prospects for publication of independent research are diminishing.\nThe now infamous Andrew Wakefield, who published a paper on the presence of vaccine-strain measles in the guts of autistic children was stripped of his license and maligned for fraud in a witch-hunt intended to suppress any further investigation into this connection. Fortunately, at least 28 independent studies from around the world have confirmed his findings.\nThe \u201cMonsanto Protection Act\u201d was designed to provide legal immunity to GM technology so that citizens could never litigate on the grounds of harm secondary to GM food exposure. In this way, corporations would be protected above farmers and citizens.\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was established in 1986 to assume liability from corporations so that any incentive to police the safety of their product was roundly eliminated and civilians could only engage in a non-jury-mediated \u201ctrial\u201d of red-tape and rejection as a means of seeking justice for injury.\nThis is where the rubber meets the road on these issues, and, truly the source of all corruption. When those regulating a system in need of checks and balances are the same people who have profited or are profiting from its protection and success, we have a critical breakdown in protection of the interests of consumers and patients.

In January 2011, Elias Zerhouni, former director of the NIH became President of Sanofi-Aventis\u2019 research labs. These relationships are known to be kindled far in advance of the job acceptance.
