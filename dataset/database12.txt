But professions for English majors are much more numerous than most people think. Because of their highly developed skills in reading, writing, critical thinking, and understanding of the human condition, English majors have a great advantage in professions as diverse as law, poetry-writing and medicine.\nThe major in English is a traditional course of study in literature and composition for the student who plans to attend graduate school (in English or another field) or to take a job not requiring certification to teach.\nThe program prepares the student for successful performance along a great variety of professional paths having to do with precise verbal expression and with philosophical knowledge of the human condition. The program requires coursework in writing, literary study, and critical theory, but it also asks the student to choose several elective courses to suit his or her personal interests.\nStudents study literature from various world cultures, especially British and American. Our English major alumni are prepared to compete for good graduate school positions, and they are well-equipped to enter many positions in the world of business that require high-level reading, critical thinking and writing skills. Their literary studies make them particularly suitable candidates for positions requiring a balanced understanding of human beings and their potential.\nProgram Plan (pdf)\n|Want to see exactly what classes you will take?

Working distance is the distance between the back of the lens and the target object.\nIn remote sensing, the solid angle through which a detector element (a pixel sensor) is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation at any one time, is called instantaneous field of view or IFOV. A measure of the spatial resolution of a remote sensing imaging system, it is often expressed as dimensions of visible ground area, for some known sensor altitude. Single pixel IFOV is closely related to concept of resolved pixel size, ground resolved distance, ground sample distance and modulation transfer function.\nIn astronomy the field of view is usually expressed as an angular area viewed by the instrument, in square degrees, or for higher magnification instruments, in square arc-minutes. For reference the Wide Field Channel on the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope has a field of view of 10 sq. arc-minutes, and the High Resolution Channel of the same instrument has a field of view of 0.15 sq. arc-minutes. Ground based survey telescopes have much wider fields of view. The photographic plates used by the UK Schmidt Telescope had a field of view of 30 sq. degrees. The 1.8 m (71 in) Pan-STARRS telescope, with the most advanced digital camera to date has a field of view of 7 sq. degrees. In the near infra-red WFCAM on UKIRT has a field of view of 0.2 sq. degrees and the forthcoming VISTA telescope will have a field of view of 0.6 sq. degrees. Until recently digital cameras could only cover a small field of view compared to photographic plates, although they beat photographic plates in quantum efficiency, linearity and dynamic range, as well as being much easier to process.\nIn photography, the field of view is that part of the world that is visible through the camera at a particular position and orientation in space; objects outside the FOV when the picture is taken are not recorded in the photograph. It is most often expressed as the angular size of the view cone, as an angle of view. For normal lens, field of view can be calculated FOV = 2 arctan(SensorSize/2f), where f is Focal Length.\n- \"Cascading Milky Way\". ESO Picture of the Week.

In case of optical instruments or sensors it is a solid angle through which a detector is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.\nHumans and animals\nDifferent animals have different fields of view, depending on the placement of the eyes. Humans have an almost 180-degree forward-facing horizontal field of view, while some birds have a complete or nearly complete 360-degree field of view. The vertical range of the field of view in humans is typically around 135 degrees.\nThe range of visual abilities is not uniform across a field of view, and varies from animal to animal. For example, binocular vision, which is important for depth perception, covers only 114 degrees (horizontally) of the field of vision in humans; the remaining peripheral 60\u201370 degrees have no binocular vision (because only one eye can see those parts of the field of view). Some birds have a scant 10 or 20 degrees of binocular vision.\nSimilarly, color vision and the ability to perceive shape and motion vary across the field of view; in humans the former is concentrated in the center of the visual field, while the latter tends to be much stronger in the periphery. This is due to the much higher concentration of color-sensitive cone cells in the fovea, the central region of the retina, in comparison to the higher concentration of motion-sensitive rod cells in the periphery. Since cone cells require considerably brighter light sources to be activated, the result of this distribution is that peripheral vision is much stronger at night relative to binocular vision.\nMany optical instruments, particularly binoculars or spotting scopes, are advertised with their field of view specified in one of two ways: angular field of view, and linear field of view. Angular field of view is typically specified in degrees, while linear field of view is a ratio of lengths. For example, binoculars with a 5.8 degree (angular) field of view might be advertised as having a (linear) field of view of 305 ft per 1000 yd or 102 mm per meter. As long as the FOV is less than about 10 degrees or so, the following approximation formulas allow one to convert between linear and angular field of view. Let be the angular field of view in degrees. Let be the linear field of view in feet per 1000 yd. Let be the linear field of view in millimeters per meter. Then, using the small-angle approximation:\nIn machine vision the lens focal length and image sensor size sets up the fixed relationship between the field of view and the working distance.
