I have shared a guide on how to get from the airport to central London. Thanks to its convenient location, this sees many transit aviation passengers. With the many millions of travelers and long haul travel involved, this leaves the need for cool lounges to relax in. With that in mind I am sharing a guide below on London Heathrow Airport showers, lounges and other facilities perfect for stress-free flying.\nThese facilities are available across popular lounges on the Heathrow Airport of London. All these centers are equipped with global standards of comfort and amenities to relish. If you don\u2019t have a membership you can also purchase a day pass for the lounges.\nHeathrow Airport has 4 different terminals, starting from T2 to T5 (Terminal 1 is currently closed to make way for the much debated T2 expansion). All these are well connected via free shuttle trains and buses around the airport. All the terminals offer executive lounges with some located inside the security premises and inaccessible for transit passengers. There are also plenty of Heathrow airport lounges with showers, bars and sleeping areas.\nHeathrow Airport Shower Lounges\nLondon Heathrow Airport maintains a global status of the city and backs all the necessities in terms of lounges, shower rooms, and hotels for all travelers. These are paid in most cases, while some only require airline passes.\n- Sky Team Lounge: For an economy class traveler, Terminal 4 of Heathrow Airport offers the ever-reliable SkyTeam Lounge. Open from 5 am to 10 pm daily, travelers can get rid of any jet lag with a nice and soothing shower. Other amenities such as free WiFi, Games Room, serving of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages are available. The lounge is only accessible for departure and transit passengers from the terminal, and 3 hours stay cost 29 Pounds per person.\n- Plaza Premium Lounge Heathrow: It is a popular option for travelers at Heathrow Airport. This lounge-chain is present across all terminals of the airport, offering shower options, apart from the paid spa. The reasonably priced lounge charges 40 Pounds for 2 hours and remains open from 5 am to 11 pm daily.\n- Club Aspire: Opened in 2016, this lounge in Terminal 3 is among the most popular ones in the airport. Long-transit and travelers can make the most from the paid showers to refresh out of stress for 15 GBP. Other features include temporary rest pods for relaxing a peaceful sleep.\nHeathrow Airport Lounges By Airlines\nBelow are a further number of Heathrow airport shower facilities and additional amenities to relieve stress during a layover, transit or departure.\n- Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge: For travelers in Economy class, the popular Maple Leaf Lounge boasts 2 different sophisticated centers in the airport. You can wash your jet lag from the private bathroom with shower facilities and enjoy a wonderful complimentary snack with beverages. Located in Terminal 2B inside security, the other 2 locations are near T3 and arrivals. Air Canada travelers need bookings, starting from 375 CAD.\n- American Airlines Admiral Club: Crossing the great Atlantic Ocean welcomes you to the capital of the UK. American Airlines\u2019 travelers can rub off the stress of long haul journeys and hit the shower. Indulge your time with snacks and beverages while waiting for your connecting flight or to board.

Had a pretty fun debate about perspective on the game with Phat Booty, Maximus, and WW last night about it too.\nTo be brutally honest, I was embarassed. All year, Hawaii was fighting criticism that they don't belong in the BCS, that they're a gimmick offense, that they've played a pathetic schedule and all we did was prove all those naysayers right. This was our opportunity to prove something to the nation. To show, hey, a WAC team does belong in the BCS just as much as anybody! But no, sadly, that was not the case.\nI've been watching UH football ever since hanabata days and I'm pretty positive that the Sugar Bowl was the first time I walked away mid-game. Every UH game I attend, I stay till the final seconds. Every game on TV, I watch till the final snap (yes, even when Boise and Fresno laid 70 on us during the Timmy Chang years). But for some reason, I couldn't stand to watch the game anymore at some point during towards the end of the 3rd quarter.\nSure, Georgia probably would've made anyone look terrible the way they played that night. They came out fierce, hungry, and prepared. They're right up there with USC, LSU, and Ohio State as far as who's the best team in the country right now. But they didn't play anyone else. They played us. If they had played an Oklahoma, an Illinois, a Florida, whoever, and won by the same score, that loss wouldn't have meant as much as it did to Hawaii. Those teams all come with long traditions of winning complete with national championships. A loss this year in a BCS bowl is no big deal. They'll just reload and be right back in it next year.\nBut for Hawaii, this was a rare oppportunity to show something to the nation that for the most part, doesn't really know who we are. Sure, they've seen some highlights on Sportscenter but did they really pay attention? Probably not. Mainland people just don't care about the WAC. Ever read sports magazines or check scores on websites? The WAC is always bunched in the \"Other Conferences\" category along with the Mid-American and Conference USA. That's what we are. A side note. UH home games start too late for most fans on the mainland to give a rip about (besides gamblers trying to chase) and even though our last 4 games got national coverage on ESPN, we did not look entirely impressive in those games, despite pulling off the wins.\nI guess that's where my feelings for this game come from. I thought of it as our opportunity to prove ourselves to the \"big boys\" and to really make the country pay attention to what we've got going on out here. But we failed to do that. It's kind of funny and sad reading the paper the next day that the best thing Georgia players could find to say about us was that \"Colt Brennan took", "What type of glass was used to make Pyrex until 1998 and what material is it made of now", "Uh Oh.

For estimating site-specific cancer mortality, it was necessary to adjust the EAR(D, e, a) from Tables 12-2 and 12-3 by multiplying by \u03bbMc (a)/\u03bbIc (a), the ratio of the sex- and age-specific mortality and incidence rates for the U.S. population. That is, for site-specific mortality,\nLeukemia merits special comment. The approach for deriving incidence and mortality estimates based on relative and absolute risk transport is the same for leukemia as for other site-specific cancers, despite the fact that leukemia models were developed from LSS mortality data rather than incidence data as for other sites. This is because LSS leukemia data were obtained at a time when this disease was nearly always rapidly fatal, so that estimates of leukemia mortality should closely approximate those for leukemia incidence. In the last few decades, however, marked progress has been made in treating leukemia, and the disease is not always fatal. Thus, the committee has used the EAR model shown in Table 12-3 to estimate leukemia incidence, but has adjusted the EAR(D, s, e, a) from Table 12-3 in the manner described above to obtain estimates of leukemia mortality. In all cases, the U.S. leukemia baseline rates were for all leukemias excluding CLL.\nModels for leukemia differ from those for solid cancers in that risk is expressed as a function of age at exposure (e) and time since exposure (t) instead of age at exposure and attained age (a). Since t = a \u2212 e, ERR(D, e, a) or EAR(D, e, a) is obtained by substituting a \u2212 e for t in the models presented in Table 12-3. Note further that for the period 2\u20135 years after exposure, the EAR is assumed to be the same as that at 5 years after exposure. That is, for a = e + 2 to e + 5, M(D, e, a) = M(D, e, e + 5).\nThe approach described above for obtaining estimates based on absolute transport differs from that used by UNSCEAR (2000b) and NIH (2003), where M(D, e, a) for", "ing threatened, this time by overtourism.\nExperience Lake Baikal awakening from the winter and learn a great deal about the natural landscape, the indigenous culture of the Buryats, about ecology and the environmental problems of LAKE BAIKAL during CACSEE\u2019s 2-week Workshop.\nIn cooperation with:\nBaikal Institute of Nature Management\nBuryat State University\nHumboldt-Universit\u00e4t of Berlin", "What did Thunder Ridge demonstrate in their game against Overland", "so has a social aspect.

An adorable puppy can tug at your heartstrings but, in the end, will require a substantial investment of your time and money for a significant number of years. Making this decision impulsively can lead to frustration, disappointment, and may eventually result in the surrender of the dog to a shelter or rescue.\nThe sad fact is that, here in the US, millions of dogs are prematurely euthanatized every year. Most often it is the owners, not the dogs, who are responsible for their premature deaths. Impulsive or poorly thought out decisions that fail to consider how a particular breed and the individual dog will fit your lifestyle, both now and for the next 12 to 14 years, as well as the lack of proper socialization, training, physical activity, and attention all contribute significantly to the need for so many shelters and rescues.\nThe first question you should ask yourself, honestly . . . Why do I/we want a dog? If your answer is:\n- For my son/daughter/children\nTrust me, this will be YOUR dog. The kids will play with the dog occasionally, will groan and grumble about any dog-related responsibilities, and will probably only do them begrudgingly after significant prodding from you. Further, children's interests and activities change frequently, which will render their involvement with the dog inconsistent at best.\n- For protection\nThough the typical English Springer may bark at unusual noises or a knock on the door, good locks and an alarm system are much more appropriate and effective steps to take.\n- To breed puppies\nIf you've read the second paragraph of this piece and still feel this way, there is probably little I can offer to change your mind. But, just in case, let me restate the case a little more thoroughly. The breeding of dogs is a responsibility not to be taken lightly. If you do not intend to remain responsible for all of the puppies you produce for their entire lives, including being willing to take back and care for those who may find themselves homeless, do not enter into this endeavor. If you are planning on breeding for profit, understand that there are much easier, more profitable and ethical ways to make a buck. To responsibly and humanely breed dogs requires a significant investment of time, money, labor, knowledge (both academic and practical), patience, and emotional fortitude. Please visit a few of the shelter sites or your local shelter and witness the problem yourself. View the faces of the homeless dogs and talk to the volunteers and staff who, all too often, must take that 'final walk' with them.\n- Because Breed X is 'Cool', was in a movie you saw, is unique and exotic, is free/cheap, or other such nonsense . . .\nOne of the WORSE reasons to get a dog, or any other animal, for that matter, is because of their physical appearance or popularity due to a movie, TV show, or other publicity. And, remember to incorporate the same thoughtful consideration of whether or not to get a dog when your friend, coworker or relative offers you one of Fluffy's puppies. Dogs are never really 'free' or 'cheap' and, in reality, require significant financial, physical, time,", "school who don\u2019t really remember me\u2026if you read my site I want to meet you.

Do the people who live with you also want a dog?\n- Do you have the time and/or resources available . . . to take your dog for walks and to the vet? to bathe, brush, clip, and, otherwise, groom your dog as often as necessary? . . . will you want to play and, perhaps, work on training daily, with your dog? . . . are you willing to take your dog to puppy kindergarten and basic obedience classes?\n- Could lifestyle-altering events occur in your foreseeable future, such as a baby, caring for an elderly family member, a divorce, job uncertainty, children leaving for college, etc.? How would you deal with these changes as they impacted your ability to care for a dog?\n- Is your personality conducive to dog ownership? Do you like to have total control over your environment or 'space'? Are you a 'neat freak'? Are you flexible? Patient? Answer honestly - nobody but you will know AND, more importantly, nobody but you will have to live with the results of your trying to 'fit' your personality to a dog.\n- Is your environment prepared to accommodate a dog and/or are you willing to make the investment of time and money necessary to assure that it does? Is there a yard or park area for your dog to walk/relieve himself or herself? Is your yard, or a portion of it, fenced? If your dog will be outside for any period of time, will you provide a secure and comfortable shelter for your dog?\n- Will your dog be alone for long periods of time daily? Can you arrange for the dog to be let out for a romp, given water, medication, and playtime, as necessary, during the day? Or, will you become angered and frustrated by behavioral issues that may arise due to the fact that your dog is alone for long periods of time?\n- Are you willing to spay/neuter your dog, as soon as possible, to reduce the chance of an accidental breeding?\n- Do you travel frequently? Will it be difficult for you to find quality care for your dog when you are away?\n- Do you really LOVE dogs? If you are truly motivated by your love of dogs, or a particular dog, you most likely don't need this page. You've done your homework and are ready for a lifelong commitment. You will train and play with your dog, provide appropriate veterinary care and nutrition, you will bathe and groom him or her, happily, and the occasional behavioral problem won't throw you for a loop. If this is the case, please visit the other sections of this site for helpful articles on this breed, and further decisions that you will need to make -- puppy or adult?, adoption or breeder?, finding a breeder, preparation for your dog, training, care, and more.\nSee the Breeder Referral Page if you would like additional information on obtaining an English Springer Spaniel from a breeder who agrees to support and follow these ESSFTA Guidelines for Responsible Breeders", "This Accursed Land: An epic solo journey across Antarctica (Paperback)Lennard Bickel (author)\n- We can order this from the publisher\nThis Accursed Land tells that story; how Mawson declined to join Captain Robert Scott's ill-fated British expedition and instead lead a three-man husky team to explore the far eastern coastline of the Antarctic continent.\nBut the loss of one member and most of the supplies soon turned the hazardous trek into a nightmare.

Sounds more like condescension than a compliment to me.\nEven national sports radio hosts were getting in on it, calling us \"frauds\" and \"major disappointments\". One radio host called the Sugar Bowl a \"joke of a game\". Those comments were salt in the wounds, yet sadly accurate. Phat Booty was telling me last night that his take on the national feedback of the game was not that Hawaii played so poorly but that Georgia played that well and that there wouldn't be too much of a negative perception on Hawaii football. I really hope so.\nBut I think Hawaii's performance really hurt the chances of a mid-major team climbing up the rankings for at least the next year anyway. There are a lot of BCS conference supporters out there and do you think they'll vote a mid-major team in the Top 10 again as easily? Don't bet on it. They're gonna fight us small time teams all the way to avoid another matchup like this year's Sugar Bowl. (But with UH's schedule next year which includes Florida, Oregon State, and Cincinnati they won't be able to deny us a high ranking if we go undefeated again).\nMan, I so wish that last year's team had a chance to play against Georgia. Just imagine what we could've done with Samson Satele, Tala Esera, Nate Ilaoa, Ikaika Alama-Francis, Mel Purcell, et al. I think THAT would've been a great game.\nNow...with rumors that June Jones is as good as gone to SMU, I wonder what's in store for the Warriors next. Do we rebuild this team that June built and start from scratch? Jeez, that's a real scary thought considering who we play next year. I know that this is tangential to my original stream of thought, but man, does Herman Frazier need to go or what? This is guy is so pathetic. Talk about a guy who just sits on his ass! This guy just makes so many mistakes. And now his legacy will probably be the guy who didn't put soap in the showers and who let the most successful coach in school history leave...for SMU of all places! I've never been the biggest JJ fan but there's no denying what he's done for this program. I've always had issues with his game coaching, his cavalier attitude, and player control but the man won games, and that's the bottom line. It'll be sad to see him go, but I hope we can get a decent replacement if this rumor does indeed turn out to be true.\nWell...I guess that's it. I just felt like I needed to air out my feelings on the game. And thanks to my really interesting and fun talk on the topic last night with friends, I was able to release all of the thoughts I had been thinking about the past few days and put those words to expression.\nIn any case....no matter how I felt about this one particular game, they did have a magnificent season and really helped to unite this tiny state of ours.

The BEIR VII committee has chosen to use what Kellerer and coworkers refer to as the lifetime attributable risk (LAR), which was earlier called the risk of untimely death by Vaeth and Pierce (1990). The LAR is an approximation of the risk of exposure-induced death (REID), the measure used by UNSCEAR (2000b), which estimates the probability that an individual will die from (or develop) cancer associated with the exposure. Although the nomenclature is recent, the LAR was used by the BEIR III committee (1980b) and by the EPA (1994).\nThe LAR and the REID both differ from the excess lifetime risk (ELR) used by the BEIR V committee in that the former include deaths or incident cases of cancer that would have occurred without exposure but occurred at a younger age because of the exposure. As noted by Thomas and colleagues (1992) and earlier by Pierce and Vaeth (1989), the ratio of ELR to REID is approximately 1 \u2212 Qc where Qc is the lifetime risk of dying from the cause of interest. For example, the ELR for all cancer mortality would be about 20% lower than the REID. The LAR differs from the REID in that the survival function used in calculating the LAR does not take account of persons dying of radiation-induced disease, thus simplifying the computations. This difference may be important for estimating risks at higher doses (1+ Sv), but not at the low doses of interest for this report. Kellerer and colleagues show that the REID and the LAR are nearly identical at low doses and discuss other aspects of the LAR compared to the REID.\nThe LAR for a person exposed to dose D at age e is calculated as follows:\nwhere the summation is from a = e + L to l00, where a denotes attained age (years) and L is a risk-free latent period (L = 5 for solid cancers; L = 2 for leukemia). The M(D, e, a) is the EAR, S(a) is the probability of surviving until age a, and S(a)/S(e) is the probability of surviving to age a conditional on survival to age e. All calculations are sex-specific; thus, the dependence of all quantities on sex is suppressed.\nThe quantities S(a) were obtained from a 1999 unabridged life table for the U.S. population (Anderson and DeTurk 2002). Lifetime risk estimates using relative risk transport were based on ERR models. For these calculations,\nfor cancer incidence, and\nfor cancer mortality. The ERR(D, e, a) was obtained from models shown in Tables 12-1, 12-2, and 12-3.

Without the teamwork that existed within those brain trusts, it\u2019s easy to imagine that many important discoveries might have eluded solitary, isolated scientists for years. But the particular style of collaboration that has been practiced by scientists for centuries is starting to look old-fashioned. Scenes of white-coated researchers huddled furtively over a single microscope are a thing of the past. Collaboration in science, as in business, is going online, and a new project called WikiProteins, the first so-called WikiProfessional, is trying to find out how far technology can go to facilitate scientific discovery.\nWikiProteins, which went live in early spring, has adapted the ubiquitous Wikipedia model in an effort to aggregate biomedical information from a collection of databases and resources into a single portal. The project is being spearheaded by Barend Mons, a bioinformatician at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The goal of the project is to improve upon the existing information repositories relevant to the biomedical community by inviting the community to maintain its own collective resource. The initial data for WikiProteins comes from sources including Medline, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, GeneOntology, IntAct, and the Unified Medical Language System.\nThe wiki contains information on more than a million biomedical concepts, and allows scientists to add their own knowledge about concepts in their area of expertise. The hope is that this capability will allow scientists whose research might not otherwise intersect to learn from and collaborate with each other.
