We expect this deteriorating trend to continue in 2018, as the British retail market remains highly competitive while facing changing shopping behaviour (i.e. increasing price sensitivity and a growing share of online retail sales) and lower consumer spending. Additional issues are the weaker pound making purchases more expensive (this especially affects \u201cbig ticket\u201d and furniture retailers) and minimum wage increases, leading to increased input costs for consumers in a highly competitive and shrinking market environment.\nBusiness insolvencies are expected to increase by about 5% in 2018 after already rising over the past six months.

At its most basic, the throat mic consists of either one or two coin-sized transponders mounted on a strap, a wired connection to a radio or phone, and earphones. The transponder sits on the user\u2019s neck, absorbing the vibrations generated by the larynx and turning them into electronic audio signals, thereby transmitting sound directly from the throat.\nAbsorbing vibrations directly from the throat confers a number of advantages over conventional microphones. Boom mics cannot function in high-noise and high-wind environments because they are sensitive to all sounds carried by the air. Throat mics, however, pick up only vibrations from the throat, and are insensitive to background noise and wind turbulence. Depending on the quality of the transponder, a throat mic can also pick up whispers, allowing the wearer to communicate covertly without giving away his or her position. Throat mics have the additional advantage of being non-obstructive. They can be worn with helmets, masks, HAZMAT suits, and full-face breathing apparatuses. Because they do not interfere with the use of other equipment and are highly adaptable to a variety of extreme acoustic environments, throat mics are ideal for a wide variety of tactical and recreational applications.\nThere are a number of disadvantages as well. Throat mics tend to cost more than conventional microphones. Also, because the transponder rests on the throat, sounds that are naturally generated in the nasal cavity and by the tongue and lips are muffled. In addition, the clarity of the transponder\u2019s transmissions can be affected by the amount of adipose tissue and facial hair on the user\u2019s neck. As a rule, the closer to the center of the throat the transponder is, the louder the transmission will be. Placing the transponder too close to the center, however, will increase muffling. To optimize sound quality and volume, th", "June 27, 2001\nBy Karen Kenworthy\nIN THIS ISSUE\n- From The Top Down\n- Who Owns What?\n- Karen's WhoIs\n- All of Karen's \"Power Tools\"\n- Subscription Information\nI missed you last week!\nMy Mom and I drove to a small town in southern Oklahoma, to visit William, my Mom's oldest brother. Uncle Bill just celebrated his 82nd birthday, and he's slowed a bit by some recent medical problems. But he's still full of life.\nAnd he's brimming with wonderful stories. I learned about Grandpa Lee, my great-grandfather. And even heard a few stories about Grandpa Noah, my great-great-grandfather! I never knew my ancestors had been such shining lights in the moonshine industry. :)\nFrom The Top Down\nUncle Bill has temporarily satisfied my curiosity about my relatives. But there's still a lot I'd like to learn. To further my quest for knowledge I recently wrote a new Power Tool, one I call Karen's WhoIs. And I can't wait to tell you about it. You'll be amazed what it can uncover ...\nBut first, let's quickly review the way the Internet's publicly accessible computers and services get their names -- a naming system called the Domain Name System.\nProgrammers call this system \"hierarchical,\" meaning it consists of several layers or levels. Each level is called a \"domain,\", which is Internet-speak for a group of computers. Putting this all together, we saw that Internet names look something like this:\nTop-Level Domain (TLD)\nSecond-Level Domain (SLD)\nThird-Level Domain (3LD)\n... (additional domain levels if needed)\nLowest-Level Domain (LLD)\nHmm... That doesn't look quite right. In reality, domain names aren't stacked one on top of each other. Instead, they are placed side-by-side. The lowest-level domain is listed first, or on the left. And the top-level domain is listed last, at the far right-side of the full name. Each domain is separated from the others by a period.\nPutting it all together, a full Internet name looks something like this:\nThat looks better!\nTo name your favorite computer or service, start by choosing a Top-Level Domain. Many of the Internet's TLDs, such as \"com\", are famous. This TLD includes microsoft.com, sony.com, karenware.com, and other captains of industry.\nInternet sites belonging to American colleges and universities, such as mit.edu, westminster-mo.edu, and sbu.edu, belong to the \"edu\" TLD. Other popular Top-Level Domains include \"net\", \"org\", \"gov\" and \"mil\". Together with the less well-known \"int\", these make up what Internet folks call the seven generic TLDs or gTLDs.\nBut there are over 240 other TLDs in use around the Internet. The rest are called country code TLDs (ccTLDs), since each corresponds to one of the two-character codes assigned to the world's countries by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization).\nMost Internet veterans have seen several ccTLDs. Among the most popular are \"uk\" (United Kingdom), \"au\" (Australia), \"fr\" (France), \"ca\" (Canada) and \"jp\" (Japan). Other ccTLDs are real collector's items, such as \"aq\" (Antarctica) and \"tk\" (Tokelau).\nOnce you've settled on a TLD, it's time to choose a Second-Level Domain name for your computer or service. Here you can be more creative. Unlike your chosen TLD, an SLD can be almost any thing you like.\nBut there are a few restrictions. First, like all domain names, an SLD cannot contain more than 63 characters. And most importantly, it must be unique, or not already chosen by someone else, within the next higher domain.\nOnce you've chosen a TLD and an SLD, you can stop. Or not. For example, consider a software company called Microsoft. It has chosen the SLD \"microsoft\" within the \"com\" Top-Level Domain. As a result, it can give its computer the Internet name \"microsoft.com\".\nShould they ever grow large enough to own more than one computer, they can tell them apart by assigning third-level domain names to each. For example, if Microsoft were to someday operate a web site, the computer that handles that job might be called www.microsoft.com. A computer that provides support to customers might be named support.microsoft.com.\nWho Owns What?\nYou may not have thought of it before, but every domain, no matter what its level, is controlled by some person or organization. Technically, the entire Internet Domain Name System is controlled by a non-profit corporation called ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (http://www.icann.org ).\nBut ICANN has delegated the control of all TLDs to various organizations. For example, the \"net\" TLD is controlled by a company called Network Solutions, Inc., in Herndon, Virginia. The same company also controls the \"edu\", \"net\" and \"org\" gTLDs. The \"mil\" TLD is controlled by the \"DoD Network Information Center,\" an agency of the United States Department of Defense.\nMost country-specific TLDs are controlled by a government agency or university. For example, Australia's ccTLD, \"au\", is controlled by the Australian Research Network, a part of the Computer Science at the University of Melbourne. A non-profit organization called Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) controls Canada's TLD. And in the Netherlands, control of their \"nl\" TLD is handled by \"Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland.\"\nICANN keeps track of which organization controls which TLD in a special database. But what about the millions of SLDs in use around the Internet today? Who makes sure the same SLD isn't assigned twice, within a particular TLD? And who knows the owner of each SLD?\nThe answer is simple: Each TLD is required to maintain a Registry, or datab", "The North Augusta City Council gave Project Jackson first-reading approval by a 6-1 vote Monday night.\nTwo more readings of the ordinance amending an existing Tax Increment Financing district to fund the $144 million public-private riverfront development are required.\nCouncilman James Adams was the lone opposing vote, saying he disapproves of government involvement in private investment.\nThe vote followed a nearly two-hour public hearing with residents voicing both support and opposition for the project, which features an Augusta GreenJackets stadium, a hotel and conference center, a YMCA, housing, and retail and office space near the Hammond\u2019s Ferry neighborhood.\nThe TIF district has received support from the Aiken County school board and county council.

We were really pleased about that \u2013 adopting the common risk factor approach.\"\nProfessor Freeman says she was struck by the enthusiasm of the peer-coaching students. \"We saw people in the classroom working incredibly hard,\" she says. \"The increase in their self-esteem was great to see, they were so proud to get their health coaching qualification, and their selfconfidence grew immensely. That change was the thing that really hit me.\"\nNow it has proved to be a success, Professor Freeman and the SOHIPP project team are hoping to attract more funding to develop it and are currently at the next stage of applying.\nShe says: \"I am so pleased that we have amazing partners. I think because of partnership working it has been a success to date, but I still think we have a road to travel.\n\"What we want to do now is to get some funding to go back to the prison and conduct a feasibility study. We know it is working, but now we want to get the evidence, from that we can go ever onwards.\"\nEngaging the homeless\nProfessor Freeman has also immersed herself in a separate programme addressing social inclusion issues affecting another key vulnerable group \u2013 the homeless. The young person\u2019s project, run by her colleague at the University of Dundee\u2019s Dental School, Dr Andrea Rodriguez, ultimately aims to help young homeless people (or those at risk of experiencing homelessness) feel more included within society, but it begins with oral health education.\nRuth was inspired to take action after encountering homeless people and rough sleepers while working in London.\nShe says: \"I did clinical work in King\u2019s Cross and when I walked around in the morning some young people who were sleeping rough would come up to me. They wanted money, but instead I would take them for a coffee and a bap \u2013 I still do that around Dundee. I remember meeting a couple on the Tube, and they looked so impoverished, my heart went out to them. I think it stemmed from that.\"\nNow, there are oral health advocates across Scotland who work with homeless people in hostels and help them make dental appointments, often accompanying them to practices \"because they feel so frightened and because of the stigma attached.\"\nIt is this team effort that Ruth believes is crucial. She says: \"It\u2019s multi-disciplinary and multi-sectorial working \u2013 it\u2019s collaboration that works.\n\"I have learned from people \u2013 be it people with experience of homelessness, people working in the NHS boards and people in prison.

The sweet spot is different for everybody but generally located .5\u2019\u2019 to 1\u2019\u2019 from the center of the throat. The user should also be careful to properly tighten the throat strap; if strapped too tightly, the pressure on the transponder from the neck is too great to absorb the vibrations. Wearing the throat mic slightly loose will improve transmissions.\nOf course, the most important determinant in the quality of throat mic transmissions is the transponder itself. Many throat mics have only one transponder in order to better balance transmissions. Some of the latest models incorporate a more sensitive transponder, allowing it to more effectively pick up vibrations. The quality of throat mic transmissions also depends greatly on the radio. Recreational radios are generally too low-powered to transmit the sound from a throat mic clearly and with enough volume. It is best to pair throat mics with high-powered professional grade radios.\nIn addition to the quality of the transponder and the radio, users should consider which type of earpiece best suits their operational requirements. Most throat mics use a single-ear silicon acoustic coil to channel sound from the speaker on the neck strap, but there are also models that use helmet speakers, earbuds, and ear-hook earpieces.\nThroat mics are often connected to a PTT (push-to-talk) switch that in turn feeds into a two-way radio (in mobile phone versions, the PTT functions as an answer/end call button). The PTT is sometimes preferred by users over the VOX function, since gunfire, coughing, and traffic noise can all be loud enough to trigger accidental transmission, as can a transponder rubbing against the neck. PTT switches come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from tiny in-glove finger PTTs that wrap around the user\u2019s finger to full-surface MOLLE-spec PTTs that can be clipped to a vest. Other PTTs can be strapped to motorcycle handlebars or around the user\u2019s wrist", "Buy any two items marked\n'LAST CHANCE 3 FOR 2'\nand get a third item free!*\nDiscount applies automatically at checkout.\n*Items marked 'LAST CHANCE 3 FOR 2' only.

This is due to lower consumer confidence, decreasing household consumption (estimated to increase just 1%), higher consumer prices and higher unemployment, coupled with deteriorated real wages.\nThe decline already started at the end of 2017 as, according to the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor, in the period September-November 2017 (which includes Black Friday) non-food retail sales decreased 3.7% on a like-for-like basis, while November 2017-January 2018 sales declined 0.6%. Online sales, meanwhile accounting for approximately 15% of retail spending, grew at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailers during this period. However, with 7% online retail growth, was much lower than in previous years - a sign that even this previously fast-growing segment has been affected by the slowdown. Additionally, in January 2018 (traditionally a key part of the year for big ticket retailers) sales of furniture and household appliances were disappointing.\nAs a result of more difficult trading conditions, it comes as no surprise that profit margins have deteriorated in H2 of 2017, and further decline is expected in 2018, mainly for brick-and-mortar retailers.

But it isn't. Most of the Internet's TLDs allow people to access their Registry via (what else?) the Internet. And ICANN allows us to examine their database of TLD information too.\nFor example, here's what ICANN's database has to say about China's ccTLD, \"cn\":\nChinese Academy of Sciences\nThe Computer Network Center\nNo.4, South 4th Street, Zhong Guan Cun\nQian, Hualin (QH3) hlqian@CNNIC.NET.CN\nComputer Network Information Center\n4 South 4th Street, Zhongguancun\n86-010-62569960 (FAX) 86-010-62560928\nThe \"Registrant\" is the organization chosen by ICANN to control the \"cn\" TLD. As you can see, it's the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Their address is shown on the lines that follow the organization's name.\nNext, you can see the person chosen by the Chinese Academy all handle administrative and technical inquiries related to the domain -- a person named Haulin Qian. His email address is also shown, followed by his mailing address, phone number and fax number.\nImpressed? Let's take a look at the information Network Solutions' has on file for the SLD \"whitehouse.gov\":\nExecutive Office of the President (WHITEHOUSE-DOM)\nOffice of Administration\nWashington, DC 20503\nDomain Name: WHITEHOUSE.GOV\nReynolds, William D. (WDR)\nDomain servers in listed order:\nTo save space, I've left out some of the information. But as you can see, the organization that controls the whitehouse.gov SLD is an outfit that calls itself The Executive Office of the President, located in Washington, DC.\nIf you have a question about the administration of this SLD, you should contact William D. Reynolds at WILLIAM_D._REYNOLDS@OA.EOP.GOV. We also have a mailing address, phone number, and fax number where we can try to contact him.\nIf you're curious like me, you're wondering \"how did Karen come by all this info?\" Well, by tradition, the computer where a Registry is stored is called a \"WHOIS\" server. And programs that access these servers are usually called \"whois\" too.\nMost versions of Unix come with a \"whois\" program. And many TLDs provide access to their WHOIS server via a web site. But many of us don't have access to a Unix computer. And accessing WHOIS servers via the web can be tedious.\nMore importantly, both methods require you to know the name of the WHOIS or web server that can provide the information you're seeking. And there are over 250 WHOIS servers around the world, each holding information not available anywhere else. To make matters worse, some queries must be performed in two steps, each involving a different WHOIS server.\nFor all these reasons, and a few more, I wrote the latest Power Tool program, Karen's WhoIs. It can locate the current information about the owner of any TLD, by querying ICANN's TLD Registry. It can also provide details about the owner of most SLDs around the world.\nBest of all, you don't need to know where the information is stored. WhoIs knows the types of information each WhoIs server contains, and directs your request accordingly. If a particular request requires contacting two or more WHOIS servers, that's taken care of automatically too.\nWhat can you do with the new WhoIs program? For starters, you might find out who owns the Internet site that's been sending you all that junk email. Perhaps you're not happy with the service you've received at a commercial web site. Now you can contact the operator of the web site, via email, phone, fax, or regular mail.\nIn many cases you can discover information about a domain's Internet Service Provider too. A representative of that company will often be listed as the \"Technical Contact\" in the information provided by WhoIs.\nAdditional clues to the ISP's identity can be found in the SLD's list of \"Name Servers\". Called \"Domain servers\" in the information retrieved by WhoIs, these special computers convert domain names into numeric Internet addresses. And in most cases, at least one name server will be operated by their ISP or another company with a special relationship to the SLD.\nFor example, whitehouse.gov's Name Servers are all in the GTEI.NET Second- Level Domain. A quick check, using Karen's WhoIs, reveals that GTEI.NET is actually BBN Corporation, a company located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a pioneer in providing Internet connections and services.\nThere's a lot more to say about WhoIs, but it will have to wait until the next time we get together.

It was launched following a 2011 survey of people in prison, carried out as part of the then Scottish Executive\u2019s Dental Action Plan. The survey found that the residents\u2019 dental health was poor, with a higher proportion of missing teeth compared to the general population.\nProfessor Freeman, whose work at the University\u2019s Dental Health Services Research Unit has a strong focus on tackling health inequalities, explains: \u201cOne thing that stuck in my mind about the survey results was the social impact of poor oral health.\n\u201cI remember one man asked: \u2018What lassie would want to kiss me with teeth like this?\u2019 People also told us they would talk upwind from people because of their bad breath; others found it difficult to eat or even speak.\n\u201cWe asked them how we could solve their oral health problems, and they told us what they felt they needed.\u201d\nArmed with this knowledge, Ruth joined forces with NHS Health Scotland and colleagues from NHS Boards to launch the national oral health initiative Mouth Matters in 2014. It was implemented by oral health promotion teams in the nine NHS Boards with prisons in Scotland \u2013 home to one of the highest per capita prison populations in Western Europe \u2013 and is still going strong five years on.\nA key part of the initiative was the introduction of oral health mentoring in prisons in NHS Forth Valley, followed by a ground-breaking peer health coaching programme in a high-security prison.\nPeople in Prison, Health Coaching for Scotland (PeP-SCOT) trains people in HMP Perth to become peer health coaches and is delivered in collaboration with NHS Tayside, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) and the charity Positive Prison? Positive Futures (PPPF).\nFollowing 92 hours of training, participants receive health coaching certification and qualifications and their skills have since been used to assist fellow prisoners to make positive lifestyles choices.\n\"As a result of PeP-SCOT we witnessed short and medium-term changes in behaviour towards health, oral health, diet, exercise and smoking in the peer coaches and their clients,\" the Professor says.\nShe says her work now is \"not just about oral health\" and has become a means to improve other areas of people\u2019s lives such as smoking cessation, diet and exercise.\n\"The work that we are doing is about encouraging very small changes that could lead to wider shifts in attitudes towards health,\" she says. \"It\u2019s about working with people to maximise their capabilities and give them control of their lives.\"\nShe regards", "r podcasts, we\u2019ll really sink our teeth into GAO\u2019s nonpartisan reports on federal spending and ways to make the government work better.\nThe first Big Bite is on financial technologies.

It\u2019s a real sad day for people who watch Fox News and want accurate information because Shep was somebody who you could reliably count on.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it tilt the network towards being a partisan defender of the government?\u201d Melber asked. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a difference between doing news, doing some discussion of ideas, opinions, and ideology, or being aligned with a government.\u201d\n\u201cRight now I think probably the news divisions at Fox are just plain shell-shocked, and as you saw on the face of Neil Cavuto when he heard it live for the first time. So one of the things that will be telling in terms of what happens next is that Fox has said that they will have rotating hosts in the slot that was Shepard\u2019s in the weeks or days ahead. It will be interesting to find out whether or not these are journalists who tell the truth or whether these are opinion makers who are essentially coddling the President and his allies.\u201d\nCameron went on to talk about his friendship with Smith. \u201cShep and I go way, way back. We were hired together at the launch of the network. And he gave me my nickname\u201d \u2026 which was \u201cCampaign Carl.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 and \u2013 dirty little secret \u2013 Shep was never particularly happy about covering campaign politics,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cHe thought that once the election season was on, you couldn\u2019t really trust anything they were going to say, because they were going to tell you whatever you want to hear. And in many ways, he had to face, as I did, an awful lot of opinion hosts telling viewers what they wanted to hear as opposed to what they might need to know to be fully informed.\u201d\nCameron veered from defending Smith into a full-on attack of the President after being asked about Trump\u2019s comments regarding Smith\u2019s exit from Fox News.\nIs he leaving due to bad ratings, or some other less important reason? https://t.co/XBr7xVgarc\n\u2014 Donald J.

Children rely on adults to ensure that the necessary safety precautions are in place, so it\u2019s up to you to know how to implement this. Otherwise you\u2019re putting their lives at risk.\nDo you have the Correct Child Seat?\nThe type of car seat you need changes depending on the size of your child. Every child under a height of 150cms or a weight of 79lbs must be placed in a child restraint system. This may be a child seat or a booster cushion, depending on the size of the child. It is against the law to not have your child properly restrained in a car and may lead to 3 penalty points. The only exception to this rule is if you are a passenger in a taxi.\nRear-facing child seat\nBabies up to 13kgs must be secured in a rear-facing child seat by law. Once they are above this weight, they may then be positioned in either a rear or forward facing child seat.
