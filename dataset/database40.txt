Someone who's a little brazen and has a lot of extra time is actually getting paid to assert a claim on a few words from a movie [Street Beat, September 12].

Years, in fact, before the movie Batman Forever was released.\nThink of the possibilities with retroactive rights. And if three words from an entire movie are enough for a copyright, how about one or two words? Off the top of my head, bands like the Rolling Stones, Meatloaf, and Yes might be in a bit of trouble.

Glancing through the usual (and unusual) suspects from friends and palates I trust I noted the name Distrito amongst the offerings and it jarred a memory of the time I stood gawking at a line of ~100 trying to get into Jose Garces\u2019 taco and street food shop in Philadelphia. Could this be the same place, I thought \u2013 and sure enough, apparently the owners of Joie de Vivre hotels had tapped Garces to head the dining concept at the Saguaro in Old Town Scottsdale.\nHaving been impressed by the food (if not the company) at Garces\u2019 Amada in Philadelphia and also by the coffee at his eponymous Trading Company I google\u2019d the information and in the process also noted a $20 off certificate through localdines.com that (when paired with a menu that looked excellent for both brunch and dinner) further sweetened the deal.\nThe Reservation: With opentable reservations available but a rumored \u2018breakfast buffet\u2019 menu on the website I next set to contacting the restaurant through their website just to see what the buffet was all about and within an hour received an e-mail from GM Niels Vuijsters explaining the setup and asking if I\u2019d like to make a reservation \u2013 an offer I took him up on and after a few other questions (and time changes) set for 8:30 on Saturday night.\nThe Space: Say what you will about hotel restaurants, Distrito is a fantastic space. Set in a swanky hotel that is a bit difficult to find, and where valet is pretty much the only option (complementary to diners) I walked into the Saguaro to find a rather hip crowd of well dressed (or underdressed and cosmetically enhanced, depending on your viewpoint) falling out of Garces\u2019 Village Whisky (and their halter-tops) as I entered but after making it past the scene I found my friend Aileen waiting near the front desk while the sign for Distrito glowed to the right along with a wall of painted skulls.\nChecking in at the hostess stand I was pleasantly surprised to find Distrito 1/3 the volume of the lobby and led swiftly through the dark bar up front (do pay attention to the impressive selection of Tequila and custom stemware) to a roomy 4-top (for 2 people) we were seated amidst perhaps an 80% filled room just next to the kitchen entrance. With lively (but low decibel) music playing overhead and brightly colored tables, chairs, and decorations studding the room Distrito begs your attention \u2013 from the clothespin light fixtures and bungee cord dividers to the wall of felt balls and El Dia de los Muertos coffins it is definitely worth a stroll around the space.\nThe Service: In a word, superb. With Niels stopping by to say hello at the start of the meal and our server Michael taking time not only to explain each dish, but also to assist with my friend\u2019s food allergies and tell us about his time with the Garces empire in Philadelphia we were never for want of anything during the 2:15 meal (except perhaps more stomach capacity) and when I mentioned my fondness for Chef Garces\u2019 GTC coffee Michael, a former employee at the Philadelphia outpost, even went so far as to gift me a bag of the Reserva blend I\u2019d not yet tried. To be fair, even if the food had been awful (*spoiler alert* it wasn\u2019t) I\u2019d be going back to The Saguaro for pounds of coffee for some time to come.\nThe Food: Chef\u2019s Tasting ($45/pp) \u2013 15 different plates, plus tortillas and chips.\nChips and Salsa Mexicana with Traditional Guacamole topped with Cotija and King Crab (+ Flour Tortillas): This is what happens when you fry up thick and perfect tortilla chips, lightly salt them, and serve them along with cool and creamy avocados kissed with a bit of garlic, a dash of lime, and some cumin before topping it lightly with cheese and heavily with fresh picked crab. Generally not one to attack the chips at a Mexican restaurant my friend\u2019s aversion to avocado led to me eating every bit of this myself \u2013 something I\u2019d have probably not done if I knew 14 dishes were to follow (okay, I\u2019m lying, it was delicious and I\u2019d have eaten it all either way.)\nAngelica\u2019s ensalada de fresa \u2013 Strawberries, spinach, melon, cabrales, serrano-balsamic vinaigrette, poppy seeds: I don\u2019t know who Angelica is, but I get the idea we would get along as each of the aforementioned ingredients here was fresh, flavorful, and simply prepared with a dressing that was at once spicy and subtle. Generally not one to fancy melon I\u2019ll particularly point out the use of the ingredient in this dish as it was a cryovac\u2019d compressed version laced with simple syrup \u2013 a perfect foil to a touch of black pepper added to the salad prior to presentation.\nCeviche de Camarones \u2013 Shrimp, Spicy Tomato, Avocado, Plantain Chips: Beginning at its base with an avocado espuma and moving upwards to snappy shrimp dressed in boldly spiced tomato sauce before finishing with crunchy sections of plantain and a slice of ripe avocado this savory parfait was light and well balanced \u2013 an exploration of textures as much as flavors \u2013 and quite stunning to the eye. Knowing full well that (like most things spicy) that this was a dish my mild Midwestern palate would enjoy in the short term but regret later on I tried my best to only eat a few bites but in the end the glass stood empty and I made sure to take some prophylactic antacids before bed.\nHurache de Hongos \u2013 Forest Mushroom, Huitlacoche Sauce, Queso Mixto, Black Truffle, Corn Shoot: As my friend could not partake in this dish I wish I could say it was unmemorable, but unfortunately it was the best dish in a night of mostly outstanding cuisine. Beginning first with a pliable soft corn tortilla and then stacking on layer after layer of aromatic mushrooms plus a mixture of cheeses both mild and slightly briny this was a dish that greeted the palate well before the tongue and while the top notes of truffle were certainly notable, it was the intensity of the corn smut sauce that really put the it over the top. Seriously, if Chef Garces or anyone at his restaurant group ever reads this \u2013 bottle that stuff up and sell it at the Trading Company.\nQueso Fundido \u2013 Duck Barbacoa, Poblano Chile Rajas, Queso Mixto: Transitioning from the salads and small plates portion of the menu to the tacos, the first to arrive was a DIY affair with rich and unctuous pulled duck meat buried beneath a layer of still bubbling cheese.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of lip stains.\nI bought the pout color first, used it all, and now I have the cupcake color. I plan to continue purchasing this. I'm considering buying a bunch of them in case they get discontinued, because I love them. My Revlon gloss and stain, and my baby lips balm just take up space now because I like this better and use it in replace of all of that.\nAll the other reviews said it, but I'll say it again:\nIt's extremely hydrating for a stain! The colors that I have used are very true to packaging. I love how the bottom turns up just like a chapstick tube would. Doesn't settle into lines, and is super smooth. For me, having it available at Walmart is very convenient.\nI wore this in VINTAGE (darkest color of the collection: a flattering berry/brown color) today :)\nThis reminded me of the CLINIQUE CHUBBY STICK, and I have to say, Im really impressed by this product! Im really happy I gave this a try.\n-SOOOO MOISTURIZING! The moisture is incredible , its very creamy. I even think its CREAMIER than the chubby sticks! :O\n-Very good pigmentation\n-Convenient packaging: the crayon gives precision.\nI really really love this product, and I will surely purchase more colors!\nEveryone, GIVE THIS A TRY!:D\nWow, I am impressed. I have the colour \"Mauveous\" and its shiny, super light weight on lips but pigmented, a rosy pink hue. On me, NC20, the color just adds a brightness to my face that was missing with all the trendy nudes. Definitely buying more and at this price, ( 4.99) its amazing value as well as a DS gem.

He will face the second trial hearing on April 2.", "e forefront plus plenty of heat from the mixed pepper this was an ample serving to say the least but arriving with plenty of fresh tortillas it didn\u2019t even last long enough to cool off completely.\nPollo \u2013 Chicken Ropa Vieja, Queso Fresco, Crema, Radish: One of a quartet of tacos, and the weakest of the four in my opinion, featured tender chicken finely shredded and mixed with onions and tomatoes on a dainty flour tortilla. Sharp and acidic but nicely balanced by the combination of cheese and slightly bitter radish it was a good two-bite dish, but not nearly as memorable as the others.\nMahi-Mahi \u2013 Chipotle Remoulade, Avocado, Red Cabbage, Lime: Having heard that this was \u2018the best dish on the menu\u2019 by the valet as I parked the car I have to admit I\u2019d probably not have ordered this dish a la carte simply because I\u2019ve never once had Dolphinfish that wowed me\u2026and that would have been a mistake. Featuring the mildly flavored fish lightly fried inside a delicate plantain batter the key to this dish was actually the juxtaposition of its accoutrements \u2013 the lightly pickled cabbage foiled by the creamy avocado while a light touch of lime brought all the flavors to a point.\nCarnitas \u2013 Pulled Pork, Black Beans, Pineapple salsa: One of two pork tacos \u2013 and the first of three swine based dishes \u2013 this dish married tender shredded flesh and crispy skin with a nice balance of earthy beans and sweet salsa quite nicely. Served with a lime to add extra citrus if desired I refrained on my first bite, instead allowing a touch of bitter from the shredded radish and jicama to come to the fore and on my second bite a small spritz \u2013 a good choice that served to bring out a bit of carnitas\u2019 smoky notes.\nChorizo \u2013 Refried Beans, Tomato, Radish: A slight modification in the menu offering to accommodate my dining buddy\u2019s shrimp allergy brought this dish to our table and while I gather it would have probably been better with the camarones this overstuffed taco was still quite excellent as the spicy chorizo was wet met by the tart green tomatoes and creamy frijoles refritos.\nCochinita Pibil \u2013 Berkshire Pork Shoulder, Achiote, Pineapple BBQ: For our \u2018main course\u2019 of the evening a large bowl of smoky pork would arrive with an ample description from Michael and with aromatics abound I only wished I had saved more room. Reportedly roasted for nearly eight hours wrapped in banana leaves and subsequently braised with achiote seeds, oregano, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, sour orange, and more this was the sort of Mexican cuisine we simply don\u2019t have back in the Midwest \u2013 incredibly complex, nicely nuanced, and literally melt-in-the-mouth tender\u2026the sort of dish that makes me want to explore the region\u2019s cuisine more and more.\nEspancas Con Manzana \u2013 Garlic Spinach, Granny Smith Apple, Toasted Peanut, Anejo Tequila: The first of three side dishes to arrive with the Cochinita and certainly the most complex this large bowl featured a lot of disparate flavors and textures nicely melded by the aged tequila. A bit too garlicky and filling for so late in the meal I admittedly only ate a few bites of this but along with the remainer of the Cochinita a box was packed up for Aileen to take home, certainly enough for a light meal.\nPlantano Y Crema \u2013 Sweet Plantain, Queso Fresco: A dish that Aileen had been hoping would make an appearance on the tasting this was probably the most \u2018simple\u2019 dish of the evening yet at the same time it was also one of the best as the still young plantains were so lightly breaded that it was almost as though the coating was simply a product of caramelizing the intrinsic sugars. A sweet dish without being overly so we both additionally commented on how nicely the light cream served to smooth out the more saline notes of the cheese thus allowing it to compliment rather than overwhelm.\nArroz Con Crema \u2013 Creamy Poblano Corn Rice: Think rice pudding but make it intensely savory with plenty of spice \u2013 now make it so rich and texturally refined that all but the best risottos would pale in comparison. At $5 this is the steal of the menu and I\u2019m disappointed even now that I couldn\u2019t eat every bite of the cast iron pot.\nTres Leches \u2013 Cornmeal Cake, Roasted Pineapple, Coconut Sorbet: Moving to the sweets we would unfortunately find the first sub-par dish of the evening \u2013 a testament to the first thirteen dishes without a doubt, but a disappointment none the less. Generally a fan of tres leches cake this presentation would unfortunately fail in the very thing I\u2019d hope would make it unique; the use of cornmeal simply dried things out rather than adding texture or nuance. Disappointed a bit but heartened a bit by the high quality of the sorbet which when taken in the same bite as a piece of cake actually worked quite nicely I would like to go back and try the Dulce de Leche French Toast (on the brunch menu) at some point, but I\u2019d probably take a pass on this version for future visits.\nEl Fuerte \u2013 Flourless Chocolate Cake, Spicy Peanuts, Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse, Vanilla Bean Flan, XO Caramel, Espresso Ice Cream: Reportedly a dish for two and although I\u2019d have questioned this statement under normal circumstances it was not only enough for two at the end of such a long meal, but after taking my first bite definitely more than one person should rationally eat. Essentially three squares loosely stacked and topped with GTC Espresso Ice Cream and candied peanuts dusted with chili before a tableside pour of caramel spiked (liberally) with what I believe was Patron XO Caf\u00e9 this was one rich dessert. Dense on the bottom and light on the top with subtle differences in each bite depending on the various components sampled both Aileen and I worked on this dish slowly and bite after bite it seemed neither of us could stop until I finally threw in the napkin\u2026at least until Aileen left a single bite on the plate and I took the bait, recollected my spoon, and finished it off.\nThe Verdict: While some may piss n\u2019 moan that \u201cMexican Street Food\u201d should be served on the streets of Mexico using less esoteric ingredients than Berkshire Pigs, Hudson Valley Ducks, and Black Truffles I\u2019ll simply beg to differ and continue my belief that any cuisine can benefit from top quality ingredients in the hands of a skilled and passionate kitchen.

With the expansion of the city to include several new areas, the east belt has seen an uptake in luxury housing options, mainly owning to the spread of IT in the region. Proximity to workplaces, easy access and high disposable incomes has led to a rise in demand for villas, row houses and apartments in the premium bracket of over Rs 1.50 crores here.\nSatish B N, Executive Director \u2013 South, Knight Frank India, elaborates on the emergence of luxury options in the east. \u201cEssentially, luxury housing in the east took off in the form of mid-segment villa projects which were patronised by top executives working in IT/ITeS companies around Whitefield. The fast-paced growth of the IT/ITeS sector in the subsequent years led to increased demand for high-end luxury apartments and villas.\u201d\nAlexander Moore, Chief Executive Officer \u2013 India, LJ Hooker, says, \u201cThe first luxury options were apartments, which first appeared in the east in areas such as Whitefield, Bellandur, Harlur Road and Marathahalli. This was due to the development of the hi-tech zones here. This created high income employment in greater numbers and the effect was a demand for quality housing nearby.

Very creamy and a little moisturizing. They're very pigmented, but only stain a little. I don't mind, though. Colors are pretty and they're comfortable to wear.\nI bought my first all glossed up in love bite and I love how it is a lip stain, gloss and balm all in one. It isn't sticky at all, much like their glosses. And it is extremely hydrating, glossy and non-silicone based, which is great. The price has gone up over time, but it's still a great buy and does not dry out your lips like the Revlon kissables (but the Revlon colors are more faithful to their packaging). The pigmentation, however, is different on everyone, and there are a few tints which look alike when put onto the lips. Love bite looks very much like a vivid pink on mine, whereas the packaging looks purple. I was a little disappointed by this. As for the packaging, I like it, but they could prevent using that much plastic to help the environment.\nOverall though, the texture and the hydration is great. I would recommend looking up swatches of colors on actual lips before buying.\nI bought one of these lip glosses in Chic because it looked like a nude pinky brown in the tube. When I got home and put it on, it was more of a bubblegum pink. I decided to get another one in the colour Vintage, because it looked like a dark reddish brown in the tube. Vintage is a sort of dark mauve colour when you put it on, and after a couple of hours, it turns into a bright pink colour.\nI would say that the stain part of the name is right, but the colour really only stays around the edges of your lips, and it stays as a bright pink. It is somewhat hydrating for a little while, but after about an hour, my lips felt dried out. These could be good if you're looking for a bright pink colour, (it seems like no matter what it looks like in the tube, it looks bright pink when you put it on) and if you have a good lip balm to wear underneath it.\nA few people mentioned the smell - to me, they smell like crayons, but the smell fades a few minutes after you put it on.\nI honestly don't see myself ever wearing these, since they look so bright pink when you put them on, despite the colour they look in the tube.\nGreat price, nice packaging, great colors, I have muavulous and its great, more pinky than muave but I highly recomend it", "Finance Site Lists Most Expensive Invasive Species\nCredit: Mike Baird\nAsian carp aren't the only invasive species causing trouble in the United States.
