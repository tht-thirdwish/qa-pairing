Essentially, coins can be transferred between chains without requiring a direct connection.\nAs mentioned earlier, sidechains aren\u2019t bound to the same rules as the mainchain. Moreover, sidechains can choose their own consensus protocols and parameters. As a result, there are very few limits as to what a sidechain can be, opening up many opportunities.\nIn addition to all of the previous innovations, Horizen has also developed a unique platform for sidechain developers. Although, this platform is called the Sidechain SDK, it offers and is much more than a software development kit. As sidechains are full blockchain applications, developers would have to implement and develop consensus, network layers, wallets, and much more. The sidechain SDK, does all of that, and allows developers to focus on whats really important, specific data and customization tailored to the use case of the sidechain. It is undoubtedly clear, the team places ease of use and scalability among its core focuses.\nZenDAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) will be a sidechain application on the Horizen platform. This voting organization will consist of all ZEN holders, who will be able to vote on a given topic.\nIOHK, Horizen\u2019s partner, developed a treasury system governed by ZenDAO. Using this system ZEN holders will vote on project proposals submitted by community. This form of governance, is representative of the team\u2019s strong dedication to decentralization.\nMoreover, this decentralized form of governance can be employed for other substantial network changes. For example, as mentioned above, in future; algorithm changes can be decided via community census using decentralized governance.\nZenChat is a secure messaging application taking advantage of Horizen\u2019s privacy and security features. Users are able to send direct messages or create group chats, with the protection of Horizen\u2019s robust security and privacy protocols.\nZenChat is ideal for clients in countries where information is regulated, thus the need for decentralized private messaging clients\nHorizen Multi-tiered Node Infrastructure\nHorizen features one of the largest node networks in the cryptosphere. As a result, Horizen\u2019s blockchain is reliable, secure, and fast. Furthermore, a multi-tiered node network allows Horizen to employ their sidechain technology as well as deploy dApps.\n- Run Horizen\u2019s core instance\n- Maintain an up-to-date copy of the blockchain.\nFull nodes are normal nodes that keep a copy of the latest blockchain and provide up-time and reliability to the blockchain. Although, these nodes do not receive a reward, they are crucial in maintaining the blockchain.\n- Must hold at least 42 ZEN.\n- Able to perform challenges in less that 200 seconds.\n- Maintain 92% reliability.\nSecure Nodes are crucial to the Horizen network. Unlike full nodes, secure nodes serve a unique purpose beyond maintaining the latest blockchain. Moreover, Secure Nodes have TLS encryption which enable secure inter-node communication, hence the \u201csecure\u201d.\nSecure Node Operators collectively receive 10% of all block rewards.\n- Must hold at least 500 ZEN.\n- Able to perform challenges in less that 150 seconds\n- Requires 8GB of memory or higher\n- Requires at least 100GB of storage capacity\n- Maintain 96% reliability.\nSuper Nodes are essential to Horizen\u2019s sidechain implementation. To clarify, Super Nodes have the features of Secure and full nodes as well as the ability to host multiple services. Super Nodes will host crucial sidechain services with their greater resource allocations.\nSimilarly to Secure Nodes, Super Node Operators collectively receive 10% of all block rewards. However, since Super Nodes have higher requirements, theoretically, there should always be less Super Nodes, and thus, each node receives a higher reward than a secure node.\nHorizen\u2019s partnership with Horizen Labs is an integral part of pushing this now developed technology to the masses. Horizen Labs is a software development company, separate from Horizen. Their primary focus is developing and tailoring Horizen technology towards large scale enterprise. Moreover, with their own engineering and software development team, Horizen Labs develops applications and tools that allows businesses to take advantage of these innovations, enabling them to be more competitive within their respective industries.\nHorizen Labs themselves, boast several major partnerships which will be crucial in bringing Horizen technology to the masses.\nInput Output Honk Kong (IOHK)\nIOHK or Input Output Honk Kong is one of Horizen\u2019s notable development partners. As well as being a corporate partner, IOHK collaborates with Horizen to conduct extensive research.\nIOHK has collaborated with Lancaster University to develop a prototype of ZenDAO. As we mentioned above, within this prototype, ZEN holders are able to vote in a decentralized fashion. The research and findings are published in IOHK\u2019s research paper.\nAcademic and Corporate Partners\nHorizen has a diverse portfolio of partnerships. These academic and corporate partnerships allow Horizen to implement their ground-breaking technology seamlessly.\nA list of current academic and corporate partners can be found in the whitepaper.\nHorizen Roadmap/Future Plans\nHorizen has come a long way since its launch back in 2017. With the transition from a currency to a full-blown platform, the Horizen team has been very active and persistent. In addition to the current progress, Horizen has bold visions and plans for the future.\nBy Q4 2020, Horizen plans to have launched several sidechains operating seamlessly in addition to mainchain improvements.

The most notable changes are outlined in the latest whitepaper. This whitepaper builds upon the core fundamentals outlined in the original whitepaper. As a result, the latest whitepaper is a must read for anyone looking to get a more technical understanding of Horizen\u2019s vision.\nThe Horizen ecosystem is crucial to realizing the team\u2019s vision. It consists of several parts, each part playing a vital role within the Horizen platform.\nZEN has been a vital part of the project since its inception in 2017. Horizen employs ZEN, its native cryptocurrency, as a base layer for all operations. ZEN in-itself has several distinguishing features. In a nutshell, ZEN combines the best from Bitcoin and Zcash (the first privacy coin) and implements it within the ecosystem.\nUnchanged since the original launch in 2017, ZEN is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency. In short, transactions on proof-of-work blockchains are processed by cryptocurrency miners. This decentralized consensus method has numerous advantages and disadvantages. Learn more about proof-of-work.\nZEN currently uses the Equihash (n=200, k=9) consensus algorithm. Zcash, the first privacy coin, was the first cryptocurrency to employ Equihash. At the time of launch, Equihash (n=200, k=9) was ASIC (Learn more about ASICs) resistant, thus keeping the network as decentralized as possible.\nIn May 2018, the first Equihash ASICs were announced, virtually pushing GPU miners out of the market. At the time, many Equihash cryptocurrencies forked to change their algorithm to Equihash (n=144,k=5). This parameter modification increased the minimum memory needed to mine the algorithm by over ten times. Therefore, traditional Equihash ASICs would be unable to mine this modification of Equihash.\nUnlike those cryptocurrencies, Horizen decided to maintain Equihash (n=200, k=9). As a result, Horizen would support ASIC mining. There were several reasons that led to this decision.\n- ASIC mining would bring in more hashpower, further securing the network as 51% attacks are less likely as total mining power increases.\n- Engineering efforts were better spent of development of the sidechain architecture rather than modifications to the mining algorithm.\n- Forking to a new algorithm would result in a period of vulnerability while miners made the switch.\n- Forking would result in widespread inconvenience for both end users (ZEN holders) and platforms (exchanges).\nPut simply, the advantages of switching algorithms were not worth it.\nIt is also important to note, that algorithm switching can be revisited in the future using the Governance model (ZenDAO).\nOne of ZEN\u2019s most prominent features, is privacy. As Horizen is a Zcash fork, it inherited Zcash\u2019s privacy technology.\nZEN features optional shielded transactions which, -mask the sender, recipient, and value transacted. Zk-SNARKs are the core to these private transactions. Developed by the Zcash team, zk-SNARKs are a form of zero-knowledge cryptography.\nZero-knowledge proofs are exactly what they sound. Using zero-knowledge proofs, transactions are confirmed and validated without ever sharing information, hence zero-knowledge. Thus, zk-SNARKs allow transactions to be verified without sharing personal and sensitive information. This innovation in privacy was carried over to Horizen as it forked and implemented Zcash\u2019s privacy features.\nZEN offers two types of addresses:\n- T-Addresses \u2013 These addresses function as normal addresses without shielding capability. In order words, transactions without privacy features.\n- Z-Addresses \u2013 Also regarded as shielded addresses, Z-Addresses facilitate private transactions.\nUnlike Zcash and other privacy cryptocurrencies, Horizen uses this privacy technology and builds upon it. Using zk-SNARKs, Horizen has developed a unique platform, greatly distinguishing it from the original privacy coin itself, Zcash.\nHorizen\u2019s in house R&D team working in combination with the engineering team, have brought many innovations to market. Horizen\u2019s github repository has been very active, always a promising sign. To summarize, the team has been producing amazing results in the dark with much more to come in the near future.\nThe primary use case for the Horizen ecosystem is based on top of Horizen\u2019s sidechain architecture. This revolutionary development will allow various sidechains to run in conjunction with the mainchain, opening the potential for a myriad of real-world use cases.\nAt the center of this architecture is the main Horizen chain. The mainchain is stable, established, and secure, therefore allowing sidechains to be operated on top of the mainchain. These sidechains will work independently from one another. As a result, the mainchain will not need any information from the sidechains, staying true to the principal of privacy. In addition, this architecture allows for an unlimited amount of sidechains, which in turn means, theoretically unlimited scalability.\nSidechains are operated and maintained by Secure and Super nodes. In return, these nodes receive rewards from the mainchain as well the potential to receive rewards from the sidechain itself. This incentive structure promotes the creation of more nodes, which in turn, increases Horizen\u2019s total sidechain capacity.\nAfter over 20 months of non-stop development, the Horizen team is close to bringing their vision to market as beta release for the sidechain architecture is due to be released in March 2020.\nCross-Chain Transfer Protocol\nDeveloped in-house, the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) is a crucial part of the new sidechain architecture. This protocol is what allows sidechains to stay connected and communicate with the parent chain (Horizen). Therefore, all sidechains must use this protocol in order to ensure functionality.\nAs outlined in the whitepaper there are two types of trans", "What does the term 'persona non grata' refer to in a diplomatic context", "What structural features characterize the book's writing style", "One stock that just came roaring off its recent lows is PotNetwork Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:POTN).

The agent (who was aware of the existence of the pump) never told the buyers about it either.\nThe buyers had to spend more than $11,000 to repair the water problems and sued the former owner. At trial in the local small claims court, the buyers were awarded the maximum $6,000 damages that the court had jurisdiction to award.\nDespite the fact that the buyers had a home inspection, the court said that the previous owner had misrepresented the condition of the property, even though her basement had been dry for more than 13 years.\nThe judge in the case said, \"In my opinion, a purchaser of real estate should not have to go behind and second guess the answers to the questions contained in a Property Disclosure Statement.\n\"It is the vendor's duty to answer the questions honestly and to disclose. It is, after all, a Disclosure Statement.\"\nA leaky basement was also the subject of a representation in the disclosure statement of the 2002 Ontario decision in Swayze v. Robertson. The sellers correctly stated they were not experiencing water problems, but also indicated, incorrectly, that there was no history of cracks or water in the basement.\nDespite a home inspection revealing repairs would be required to the basement walls, the purchasers closed and later sued for $12,572 plus costs. The new owners were successful both at trial and on appeal, based on false statements made orally and in the SPIS.\nA New Brunswick case, decided in January, 2006, dealt with a property disclosure statement that incorrectly stated that the septic system had been installed 10 years earlier.\nTwo years after closing, the new owners, Christopher and Diane Boreland, experienced problems with the septic tank and had to replace it at a cost of $8,000. It turned out that the tank was made of timbers or railway ties, and was probably more than 50 years old. In addition, there was no septic bed at all, and the tank overflowed into a nearby ditch.\nThe new owners sued the seller, Walter Gilmore, who explained the misrepresentation by saying that the tank had been \"upgraded\" 10 years earlier. The trial judge found that \"the Plaintiffs have established fraud by the Defendant,\" and awarded them $8,000, plus interest and full legal costs.\nThe law in this area is that except for hidden defects which make the property dangerous or unfit to live in, sellers do not have to disclose hidden defects in a house.\nIn general, the rule is caveat emptor buyer beware. That's why purchasers use home inspectors.\nSigning a disclosure statement is completely voluntary. I always tell sellers never to sign one, but if they do they should always get the number of a litigation lawyer. A good one.

However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.\nWhen I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful. Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny. I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature. The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.\nThe film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point! The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer). Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.\nIt does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch. The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.\n71 of 86 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?\n| Report thi", "Enter identifying information about your device\nYou can enter a user, the location, and any notes for a device.\nFrom the Admin console Home page, go to Device Management Google meeting room hardware.\nTo see Device Management, you might have to click More controls at the bottom.\nRequires having the Google m", "The book has a quirky style of constantly-shifting viewpoints and writing styles.

Because the print box is fully enclosed the printer is also super quiet. The QIDI is actually very similar to the more expensive Flashforge Creator Pro and is based on the MakerBot 3D printer.\n|Print material||Auto Calibration||Maximum print size(inches)||Heating bed||layer thickness||Customer support||Assembly time||Warranty|\n|PLA,ABS||No||8.8\"x5.9\"x5.9\"||Yes||100-400 microns||Excellent||10 minutes||3 month warranty||Buy on Amazon|\n- Key Features:\n- Does The Printer Come Pre-assembled?\n- How Does The QIDI Tech 1 Compare To The Flashforge Creator Pro?\n- What Software Does This Printer Come With?\n- How Do You Switch From The Right Extruder To The Left Extruder?\n- Useful Tips To Get The Most Out Of Your QIDI 3D Printer:\n- What Customers Are Saying:\n- Final Verdict:\nThe QIDI Tech 1 has a strong metal body and a fully enclosed print box. This ensures that the machine is durable and printing runs at a consistent temperature.\nThe sides, front and top of the printer are acrylic which means that you get a good view of the printing process when the printer is running.\nThe build plate is heated and is made from aviation grade aluminum which means it is completely flat and no warping will occur even with high temperatures. The plate is supported by heat resistant metal supports to ensure durability.\nThe enhanced internal circuits are designed to prevent static while the machine is printing.\nThe dual extruders allow you to create prints of different colors which not only means more interesting prints but also makes it easier to create and then remove support structures as you\u2019ll be printing these in a different color from the main print.\nThe QIDI Tech 1 can use either PLA, ABS or TPU filament as long as the filament is 1.75 mm in diameter. It\u2019s also easy to pause the printing to add in a new color if you want to.\n3.Easy To Use LED Control Panel\nThe LED control panel is easy to read and operate using push buttons. It will even give you instructions on how to get started and has special functions for calibrating the build plate including a test print so that you can ensure that the plate is calibrated correctly.\n4.Two Filament Spool Holders\nThis 3D printer comes with 2 spool holders which are attached to the back of the machine and are 1 inch in diameter. This means that they will fit almost any filament spool you wish to use.\nThe printer is compatible with any operating system including Windows, Mac and Linux via a USB cable. Also included with the printer is a SD card which contains the easy to use Makerware Replicator software recommended by the manufacturer for creating your print files.\nThe SD card also contains sample print files which you can create using the two sample spools of filament which are included with the printer. You\u2019ll get a sample spool of both PLA and ABS filament to allow you to understand how the different filaments work in relation to the finished print.\n6.Exceptional Customer Service\nCustomer service support is absolutely brilliant and any enquiry will be responded to within 24 hours. QIDI Tech will go out of their way to make sure that you are happy with your purchase and to assist you in any way they can.\nIn fact, every printer that is sent out to a customer is tested for a full 8 hours before despatch to ensure that it\u2019s working perfectly.\nDoes The Printer Come Pre-assembled?\nOne of the advantages of the QIDI Tech 1 3D printer is that it arrives on your doorstep already pre-assembled straight out of the box. There are only a few parts that you need to attach before you can start printing.\nHere\u2019s a quick run down of the assembly required:\nWhen you receive your printer box take everything out including the printer itself which is extremely well packed to avoid any damage during transportation.\n1)Attach the extruders into the cradle using the 2 screws provided.\n2)Next attach the 2 filament spool holders to the back of the machine and put the 2 sample filament rolls on to the spools.\n3)Now you need to attach the 2 filament feeder tubes which just clip into the back of the box with snap lock clips to hold them in place.\n4)Feed the filaments through the tubes and insert them into the top of the extruders.\n5)You\u2019ll now want to calibrate the build plate using just a sheet of paper. You\u2019ll find instructions on how to do this in the included manual which is on the SD card. You can also do a test print using the LED panel as a guide.\n6)The next step is to attach the handle and hinges to the acrylic door and then install the door and the acrylic side panels.\n7)Now all that\u2019s left to do is to assemble the acrylic top and install it and you\u2019re ready to start your first print job.\nHere is a youtube video of the unboxing and assembling of the printer:\nHow Does The QIDI Tech 1 Compare To The Flashforge Creator Pro?\nThere are basically three main differences", "Although I read a lot of blogs on the topic of writing, publishing and publicity, I don\u2019t share much of what I see there. I\u2019ll be honest and say that for me, not much of what they blog seems relevant. Either that or their blog post is really an advertisement for something they\u2019re trying to sell.

A/B testing basically means that they sent newsletters with \u201ccopy A\u201d to one part of their list and newsletters with \u201ccopy B\u201d to another part of the list, and then compared sales results for each version. Each A/B mailing tested a different variable.\nThe results are fascinating \u2013 and they will help you as you write the text for your Amazon sales page, your website, your book announcement press release, your e-mail announcement, and other promotional materials that will help you sell more books, too!\nHere are the lessons from BookBub\u2019s research:\n- Quote a person, not a publication.

Similar forms are in use in other jurisdictions across the continent.\nThe OREA form lists 47 questions to be answered in writing by the sellers of each home. At present, the forms are not mandatory in Ontario, and in my experience they have been a gold mine for litigation lawyers creating more problems and disputes than they were intended to avoid.\nSellers who are presented with these forms by listing agents are invited to answer and be responsible for questions which are well beyond the knowledge of the average homeowner.\nSome of the questions, for example, are:\nAre there any encroachments, registered easements or rights-of-way?\nDoes the survey show the current location of all buildings, improvements, easements and rights-of-way?\nDoes the subject property comply with the zoning?\nIf not, is it legal non-conforming?\nWill the sale of the property be subject to GST?\nIs the property under the jurisdiction of any Conservation Authority?\nWhat is under the carpeting?\nAre you aware of any moisture and/or water problems?\nIs there any lead or galvanized metal plumbing on the property?\nSellers are also asked whether they are aware of any structural problems, non-compliance with the Ontario Fire Code, insect damage, and problems with the air conditioning, plumbing or heating systems.\nThey are asked whether the wiring is copper, aluminum or knob and tube.\nIn my experience, it is difficult to answer most of these questions accurately, since many require technical or legal knowledge.\nThe 2003 New Brunswick decision in the case of Hansen and King v. Seely is a prime example of a seller being sued, not because the house was defective, but because she signed a property disclosure statement.\nRelying on the SPIS, the buyers agreed to purchase the property in January, 2000. The owner had bought the property in 1986. She installed a sump pump and repaired a basement wall crack to repair a moisture problem, and for the next 13 years never experienced any dampness in the basement.\nA year after closing, water and silt entered the basement. At that point, the seller advised the buyers that there was a sump pump buried outside the house to divert surface water away from the basement walls.\nThat fact was never mentioned in the disclosure statement, and there was no question in the SPIS form about t", "What mining algorithm does Horizen's native cryptocurrency ZEN use", "Spread the Joy!\nMaking noodles can be pretty easy.

He also received a Paul Robeson Award from Oakland\u2019s Ensemble Theater for his work as a director and actor. In addition to his acting roles, Lange has written and directed several film projects, including the critically-acclaimed drama The Love Boat.\nTed Lange was born on 5 January 1948 in Oakland, California. His career began as an actor, but his desire to be involved in other areas of entertainment eventually led him to write screenplays and direct plays. He also worked as a stage director and writer, and eventually became a multi-millionaire at the age of 71.\nTed Lange\u2019s net worth has tripled in recent years.

This is particularly useful when printing with PLA to allow additional airflow and cooling.\nThe printer spools on the Flashforge only allow the use of filament spools which have a large 2 inch diameter hole while the QIDI can accommodate spools with 1 inch diameter holes and everything above. This means you can use almost any brand of filament such as the smaller and very popular Hatchbox filament.\nWhat Software Does This Printer Come With?\nThe included SD card contains the Makerware Replicator software and Sailfish which converts the printing instructions from Makerware to the language (.x3g) that the 3D printer understands to execute the printing process.\nIt is also possible to use Simplify 3D to create your printing designs if you prefer to use this program.\nHow Do You Switch From The Right Extruder To The Left Extruder?\nYour extruder set up is all programmed within the slicing software that you\u2019re using. When you create your print job, you need to specify which extruder the printer is to use for each section of the model you\u2019re going to print.\nThis includes using different colors. Just make sure that you have the correct colors in the correct extruders as specified in your print design.\nUseful Tips To Get The Most Out Of Your QIDI 3D Printer:\nTry not to leave prints on the build plate to completely cool down as you may find that they can be difficult to remove.\nStore your filament in a sealed bag to avoid contact with moisture.\nWhen printing with PLA, make sure you turn on the turbo fan as the fan switch defaults to the off position. This will avoid stringiness and lack of adhesion in your finished prints.\nIf you\u2019re having some problems with your prints sticking to the build plate especially when using PLA, try putting some glue on the plate first. You could also try using hairspray. Soak a piece of paper towel with hairspray and wipe over the build plate. Allow it to dry before starting your print job. You may need to repeat this after a few prints.\nFor further support and other helpful tips, there\u2019s an excellent support group for the QIDI Tech 1 on Thingiverse. You\u2019ll also find some interesting print files available including accessories you can print for your QIDI printer such as more sophisticated spool holders and glass bed clamps in case you want to add a glass top to your build plate.\n3 months, however support is excellent if you have any problems.\nWhat Customers Are Saying:\nAfter reading hundreds of reviews on this printer we found that 76% of customers were entirely happy with this printer and gave it a rating of 5 out of 5 stars. There were numerous mentions of the excellent customer service provided by QIDI Tech including fast shipping of replacement parts if needed as well as excellent guidance on installing these and extra parts as bonuses.\nMost customers have commented on the quality and sturdiness of the printer itself and also on the level of detail that the printer produces in each print job. In fact one customer was so happy with the quality of the prints that he has started a business using his QIDI 3D printer.\nWe found many reviews from first time 3D printer users and all have been amazed at how easily and quickly they were able to produce quality prints with their QIDI Tech 1.\nA few customers reported that they had the x-axis cable fail after a few prints. Fortunately there is a spare cable included with the printer and a youtube video available to show you how to replace the cable if needed.\nThe only negative reviews we found were centered around the quality of the sample filament which is included with the printer. As this included filament is only meant for test print jobs, this is definitely not a concern as you will be purchasing your own filament for your 3D print projects.\nThe QIDI Tech 1 Dual Extruder 3D printer is well constructed and very durable. It comes mostly pre-assembled with only a little assembly required before you can start your first print job.\nBeing a fully enclosed printer means that it is much quieter than some other 3D printers and works really well with ABS filament. The acrylic sides not only allow you to better view the printing process but are removable which is highly recommended if you\u2019re using PLA filament.\nThe build plate is easily calibrated and heated to ensure good adhesion of your print job as long as you make sure that the plate is heated to the correct temperature before starting the print.\nThe dual extruders allow you to print in more than one color and also make it easy when you\u2019re using support structures for your print.\nThis 3D printer is an excellent choice if you\u2019re new to 3D printing but also great if you\u2019re looking for an additional printer to add to your collection. It is great value for money and the customer support is exceptional", "Samuel Fiifi Hammond is a remarkable student.
