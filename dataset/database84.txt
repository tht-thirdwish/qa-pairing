And this year, it's worth noting, Kenseth wouldn't even publicly acknowledge his free agent status.\nIf he was going for a big payday, he perhaps could have used the media to gain leverage -- either with Roush or potential suitors -- but instead, he kept quiet about it the whole time.\nSources told SB Nation that Kenseth might actually be taking a pay cut with his new team rather than scoring a bigger deal. If he'd remained at Roush, though, he may have gotten even less due to the sponsorship situation there.\nRoush will save millions per year by signing Stenhouse Jr. instead of Kenseth, which will lower the price point for sponsorship.\nWhy can't Kenseth and his new team (again, likely JGR) just announce their deal now? Are there sponsorship concerns still to be worked out?\nKenseth said he simply couldn't talk about the details of where he's headed in 2013, even the reasons why an announcement can't be made yet. He said the news will be made public \"hopefully sooner than later\" and all sides had already reached an agreement, including his new sponsors.\n\"Everything is set; everything is in place,\" he said. \"I think we're good there. I feel good about '13 and beyond. I don't think it's any of that.\"\nThe driver said his new team -- which he called \"another very winning organization\" -- is a good fit for him and he believes he can be successful there.\nIsn't Kenseth getting kind of old to start over with a new team?\nNot at all. Though Kenseth is 40, that's not old for a race car driver. Tony Stewart just won the championship at 40 last year, and Mark Martin is still racing competitively at age 53.\nKenseth said Wednesday it's impossible to say right now how much longer he plans to race.\n\"I just don't know,\" he said. \"And by saying 'I don't know,' I feel like that means I'm so far away from the end or when I want to walk away that I can't even fathom when that is. I sure hope to be driving for a long time.\"\nWhy can't the media just respect Kenseth's decision and leave him alone?\nKenseth knew there were questions about his move and wanted to fulfill interview requests for as many reporters as possible. It was his decision to talk for so long.\nHe spent three straight hours on Wednesday afternoon doing phone interviews with 13 different reporters and answering mostly the same questions the entire time.\nI'm still confused. Will all the details about Kenseth's decision come out eventually?\nNot if the driver has his way. Kenseth, who has always been a private person, said there's nothing to be gained by talking about some of the specific conversations or factors that led to the move.\n\"There are a fair amount of closed-door things or feelings or circumstances or whatever that will probably never get talked about, just because it doesn't do anybody any good at the end of the day,\" he said.\nThat said, once Kenseth and his new team make their announcement, everything might make more sense.", "support.

Paugnut State Forest is part of a 2,410 acre, contiguous park and forest complex that includes Burr Pond State Park and Sunny Brook State Park. Popular activities include hiking, mountain biking, hunting and cross country skiing. Burr Pond State Park is a great place to spend a summer afternoon. Burr Pond offers fishing, boating and swimming and the surrounding area is great for hiking.\nEast of Winchester Lake is the American Legion and Peoples State Forests. These two forests offer camping, mountain biking, hiking, hunting, picnic facilities, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling trails. The West Branch of the Farmington River, designated as a Wild and Scenic River by the National Park Service, is the focal point of the heavily forested land and offers river-based recreational activities including trout fishing, canoeing, kayaking and tubing. East of Winchester Lake is Crystal Lake, a primary source of drinking water for the town of Winchester. The 145-acre sparking lake is also known for its boating and excellent trout fishing. Highland Lake, located just a few miles east of Crystal Lake is a 444-acre sparkling lake known for its bass, salmon and trout.\nThe city of Winsted, located within the town Winchester, lies east of Winchester Lake. The town is noted for its stately Victorian, Greek Revival, Neo-Classical, Ecclesiastical, Queen Anne and Colonial Revival homes. The Main Street area is lined with unique shops and restaurants. For children there is a skateboard park, a huge Playscape park, ball fields, and miniature golf with batting cages and go carts. Golfers will find a several golf courses in the area. Winsted also provides the area with complete shopping facilities\nLess than a half hour south is the City of Torrington, the largest city in Litchfield County. Visitors to Winchester Lake will find Torrington to be a mix of retail and tourist attractions. The downtown area is as a thriving cultural center, boasting the Warner Theatre and the renowned Nutmeg Conservatory. Antique dealers, art galleries, art deco architecture and small specialty shops make the area appealing for residents and tourists alike. There are also a number of city parks and hiking trails that allow visitors to truly enjoy the beauty of the area.\nNo matter what your reason for visiting Winchester Lake, you are sure to be treated to scenic views and beautiful inviting water.

However, the relative contribution of these mechanisms is unknown. In this study, we modeled the repressive effects of iPTH on Scl production in mice by treatment with a neutralizing anti-Scl antibody (Scl-Ab) to determine the contribution of T-cell\u2013produced Wnt10b to the Scl-independent modalities of action of iPTH. We report that combined treatment with Scl-Ab and iPTH was more potent than either iPTH or Scl-Ab alone in increasing stromal cell production of OPG, osteoblastogenesis, osteoblast life span, bone turnover, bone mineral density, and trabecular bone volume and structure in mice with T cells capable of producing Wnt10b. In T-cell\u2013null mice and mice lacking T-cell production of Wnt10b, combined treatment increased bone turnover significantly more than iPTH or Scl-Ab alone. However, in these mice, combined treatment with Scl-Ab and iPTH was equally effective as Scl-Ab alone in increasing the osteoblastic pool, bone volume, density, and structure. These findings demonstrate that the Scl-independent activity of iPTH on osteoblasts and bone mass is mediated by T-cell\u2013produced Wnt10b. The data provide a proof of concept of a more potent therapeutic effect of combined treatment with iPTH and Scl-Ab than either alone. \u00a9 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\nPTH; BONE; SCL; ANTIBODY; T CELLS; WNT10B\nMultifrequency atomic force microscopy imaging has been recently demonstrated as a powerful technique for quickly obtaining information about the mechanical properties of a sample. Combining this development with recent gains in imaging speed through small cantilevers holds the promise of a convenient, high-speed method for obtaining nanoscale topography as well as mechanical properties. Nevertheless, instrument bandwidth limitations on cantilever excitation and readout have restricted the ability of multifrequency techniques to fully benefit from small cantilevers. We present an approach for cantilever excitation and deflection readout with a bandwidth of 20 MHz, enabling multifrequency techniques extended beyond 2 MHz for obtaining materials contrast in liquid and air, as well as soft imaging of delicate biological samples.\natomic force microscopy; multifrequency imaging; nanomechanical characterization; photothermal excitation; small cantilevers\nTropical forests are being rapidly altered by logging, and cleared for agriculture. Understanding the effects of these land use changes on soil fungi, which play vital roles in the soil ecosystem functioning and services, is a major conservation frontier. Using 454-pyrosequencing of the ITS1 region of extracted soil DNA, we compared communities of soil fungi between unlogged, once-logged, and twice-logged rainforest, and areas cleared for oil palm, in Sabah, Malaysia. Overall fungal community composition differed significantly between forest and oil palm plantation. The OTU richness and Chao 1 were higher in forest, compared to oil palm plantation. As a proportion of total reads, Basidiomycota were more abundant in forest soil, compared to oil palm plantation soil. The turnover of fungal OTUs across space, true \u03b2-diversity, was also higher in forest than oil palm plantation. Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal abundance was significantly different between land uses, with highest relative abundance (out of total fungal reads) observed in unlogged forest soil, lower abundance in logged forest, and lowest in oil palm. In their entirety, these results indicate a pervasive effect of conversion to oil palm on fungal community structure. Such wholesale changes in fungal communities might impact the long-term sustainability of oil palm agriculture. Logging also has more subtle long term effects, on relative abundance of EcM fungi, which might affect tree recruitment and nutrient cycling. However, in general the logged forest retains most of the diversity and community composition of unlogged forest.\nTropical forests are being rapidly altered by logging and cleared for agriculture. Understanding the effects of these land use changes on soil bacteria, which constitute a large proportion of total biodiversity and perform important ecosystem functions, is a major conservation frontier. Here we studied the effects of logging history and forest conversion to oil palm plantations in Sabah, Borneo, on the soil bacterial community. We used paired-end Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, V3 region, to compare the bacterial communities in primary, once-logged, and twice-logged forest and land converted to oil palm plantations. Bacteria were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity level, and OTU richness and local-scale \u03b1-diversity showed no difference between the various forest types and oil palm plantations. Focusing on the turnover of bacteria across space, true \u03b2-diversity was higher in oil palm plantation soil than in forest soil, whereas community dissimilarity-based metrics of \u03b2-diversity were only marginally different between habitats, suggesting that at large scales, oil palm plantation soil could have higher overall \u03b3-diversity than forest soil, driven by a slightly more heterogeneous community across space. Clearance of primary and logged forest for oil palm plantations did, however, significantly impact the composition of soil bacterial communities, reflecting in part the loss of some forest bacteria, whereas primary and logged forests did not differ in composition. Overall, our results suggest that the soil bacteria of tropical forest are to some extent resilient or resistant to logging but that the impacts of forest conversion to oil palm plantations are more severe.\nSince the invention of hybridoma technology, methods for generating affinity reagents that bind specific target molecules have revolutionized biology and medicine. In the postgenomic era, there is a pressing need to accelerate the pace of ligand discovery to elucidate the functions of a rapidly growing number of newly characterized molecules and their modified states. Nonimmunoglobulin-based proteins such as DARPins, affibodies, and monobodies represent attractive alternatives to traditional antibodies as these are small, soluble, disulfide-free, single-domain scaffolds that can be selected from combinatorial libraries and expressed in bacteria. For example, monobodies\u2014highly stable scaffolds based on the immunoglobulin VH-like 10th fibronectin type III (10Fn3) domain of human fibronectin\u2014have yielded antibody mimetics that bind to numerous targets for applications including intracellular inhibition,[5,6] therapeutics, and biosensors.[6,8] These 10Fn3-based ligands can be derived from highly diverse libraries using techniques such as phage, ribosome, mRNA, bacterial, and yeast displays.\nantibodies; directed evolution; mRNA; ligand design; selection methods\nModern high-speed atomic force microscopes generate significant quantities of data in a short amount of time. Each image in the sequence has to be processed quickly and accurately in order to obtain a true representation of the sample and its changes over time. This paper presents an automated, adaptive algorithm for the required processing of AFM images. The algorithm adaptively corrects for both common one-dimensional distortions as well as the most common two-dimensional distortions. This method uses an iterative thresholded processing algorithm for rapid and accurate separation of background and surface topography. This separation prevents artificial bias from topographic features and ensures the best possible coherence between the different images in a sequence. This method is equally applicable to all channels of AFM data, and can process images in seconds.\nadaptive algorithm; artifact correction; atomic force microscopy; high-sp", "What criticisms does the author express regarding the government's spending priorities and their impact on Canadians", "What actions did the committee propose to increase communication and improve best practices related to data management and distribution", "What was the location of the date between Jennifer Lopez and Diddy", "Welcome to the Priess Lab\nThe Priess Lab is located at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Was stability the reason he left?\nThe stability of just having a job and staying in the sport ranks \"almost on the bottom\" of his priority list, Kenseth said.\n\"Winning races and trying to race for championships is on the top of my list, because you never know how long you can do this stuff,\" the 40-year-old said. \"You never know when your last race is or your last lap is or your last win is or any of that.\"\nReading between the lines on everything that's happened, it seems like the decision to leave was Kenseth's -- though it certainly doesn't hurt Roush to move one of its younger, cheaper drivers in Ricky Stenhouse Jr. up the ladder into the Sprint Cup Series.\nIf Kenseth is having such a solid year and leading the points, why did he go looking for another team?\nHe didn't. Other teams knew Kenseth was a free agent who was unsigned past this season, and the driver said he was approached by one who had an opportunity that intrigued him. As recently as a month or two ago, Kenseth planned on being at Roush for his entire career -- just as team owner Jack Roush said he did.\nWhen he got the initial phone call expressing interest, Kenseth said he didn't think, \"Yeah, that's what I'm going to do for sure.\"\n\"But after some talking and getting to know some people and some things that were happening, I think it just felt like it was the right thing to do,\" he said. \"You look back and you're like, 'Oh man, I hope this is right.' But I felt really strongly it was the right thing to do and that was the place for me and the time to go do that. And I still feel like that.\"\nWas there a behind-the-scenes argument at Roush that we don't know about?\nNot according to Kenseth, who said he knows the lack of \"one great reason\" makes it harder for reporters and fans to understand his decision.\n\"It's a combination of a lot of things and timing,\" he said. \"There's nobody that was mad. There wasn't a fight, there wasn't a disagreement or somebody not doing something. There wasn't really any of that. I know that doesn't sound like a good answer, but that's really the truth.\"\nKenseth said there was \"no resistance from anywhere,\" and that it felt like all the pieces just fell into place for his move to happen. It certainly helped Kenseth to know Roush wanted to get Stenhouse Jr. into a Cup car.\n\"I really think things happen for a reason and things line up like that sometimes,\" he said. \"When they do, that's how it was meant to go \u2013 and that's what happened here.\"\nOK, but this is all", "What types of input and output connections are equipped on the device mentioned in the text", "What is the purpose of using elegans as a model system", "What are the two fragrance options mentioned in the text for Downy liquid fabric softener", "What does Steven Schoenberg's music incorporate in terms of styles as described by Tom Regan", "Uncle the man for Johnson\nUncle Jimmy (9/4) profited from the early depature of well-supported favourite, Seabright in the opening contest on Fontwell's National Spirit card.\n- Related Content\nVictor Dartnall's charge was bidding for a hat-trick but made an unfortunate departure on the first circuit - leaving the race wide open.\nThe winner, who had already scored at Fontwell over 2m4f looked to be struggling in the closing stages but he had built up enough of a lead to still be five lengths clear of Royal Native at the finish.\nThree of the five participants looked in with a chance in the Josh Gifford Memorial Novices' Chase but it was Shoegazer (7/4) that was to prevail.\nDavid Pipe's charge has been struggling to win in handicaps but he appeared to appreciate this return to novice company to wrestle the prize", "favorite Downy liquid fabric softener for an enhancing burst, and find your laundry routine transformed into a thrilling sensory experience.\nWhether you prefer the clean crispness of Fresh (combine it with Clean Breeze) or the soothing indulgence of Lush (with Simple Pleasures Lavender Serenity), you\u2019ll be glad to know that Unstopables fragrances stick around till you\u2019re ready for laundry day\u2019s return.\nBuy wherever Downy is sold.

Like OPCs, anthocyanosides may strengthen capillaries through their effects on collagen. Proteolytic enzymes (such as bromelain ) are also thought to possibly help stabilize capillaries. However, no studies have directly addressed the potential value of either of these treatments for nosebleeds.\nVitamin C is vital for the development of normal collagen. People with scurvy (severe vitamin C deficiency) may bleed easily from the nose, as well as developing spontaneous bruises and other bleeding symptoms. However, there is no evidence as yet that vitamin C supplementation helps to decrease nosebleeds in the absence of true scurvy, a condition that is rare today.\nThe herb shepherd's purse ( Capsella bursae pastoris ) has been traditionally used as a topical application to control nosebleeds, although scientific evidence of its effectiveness is lacking.

At 229 acres, the crystal clear water of the lake offers visitors and residents plenty of opportunity for fishing and boating. Although the forested shoreline is fairly developed with private homes, visitors can gain access to the awaiting water through a public boat launch on the southern shore adjacent to the Winchester Lake dam.\nWinchester Lake is a manmade lake created by a dam on the headwaters of the East Branch Naugatuck River completed in the late 1920s. The lake averages nine feet deep with a maximum depth of 17 feet. Most of the deep water is in the southern end of the lake near the dam. The northern end of the lake is fairly shallow. Rather than cut the trees in the area when the dam was first constructed, engineers allowed the forest to flood and later cut the tree tops during winter ice. Today submerged trees and stumps abound throughout the lake. Although a bit of an obstacle course for boaters, the lake is known for its largemouth bass and northern pike. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection began stocking northern pike into the lake in 2005. Anglers are now reporting pike exceeding the state's 26-inch size limit, with many of these fish reaching 36 inches. The dam is a popular spot for fishing, but anglers should use heavy line to deal with the numerous underwater snags. Note: Although most fish taken from Connecticut lakes and streams are safe to eat, refer to the Connecticut Fish Consumption Advisory (link below) before eating fish caught from any Connecticut waterway.\nWinchester Lake's beautiful setting, varied shoreline and rocky coves make if a favorite destination for boaters and paddlers. An eight MPH limit on motorboats keeps the water calm and peaceful. Due to the abundance of submerged trees, flat bottom boats, canoes and kayaks will have the easiest passage across the lake. For those who would like to spend some time in the area, vacation rentals and private real estate are abundant as well as additional lodging in the nearby city of Winsted.\nCampers will find several private campgrounds near Burr Pond State Park, southeast of Winchester Lake. Camping is also available in the American Legion State Forest located east of Winchester Lake.\nFor additional outdoor recreation, Dennis Hill State Park is located northwest of Winchester Lake.

Thus, our findings suggest that intravenous zanamivir, at a dose of 600 mg Q12h, could be used to treat hospitalized patients suffering from serious infections with oseltamivir-sensitive or -resistant influenza viruses.\nIn this study, we pilot tested an in vitro assay of cancer killing activity (CKA) in circulating leukocytes of 22 cancer cases and 25 healthy controls.\nUsing a human cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, as target cells, we compared the CKA in circulating leukocytes, as effector cells, of cancer cases and controls. The CKA was normalized as percentages of total target cells during selected periods of incubation time and at selected effector/target cell ratios in comparison to no-effector-cell controls.\nOur results showed that CKA similar to that of our previous study of SR/CR mice was present in human circulating leukocytes but at profoundly different levels in individuals. Overall, males have a significantly higher CKA than females. The CKA levels in cancer cases were lower than that in healthy controls (mean \u00b1 SD: 36.97 \u00b1 21.39 vs. 46.28 \u00b1 27.22). Below-median CKA was significantly associated with case status (odds ratio = 4.36; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.06, 17.88) after adjustment of gender and race.\nIn freshly isolated human leukocytes, we were able to detect an apparent CKA in a similar manner to that of cancer-resistant SR/CR mice. The finding of CKA at lower levels in cancer patients suggests the possibility that it may be of a consequence of genetic, physiological, or pathological conditions, pending future studies with larger sample size.\nIt has been proposed that elements of the renin angiotensin system expressed in the arterial wall are critical for the development of atherosclerosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is highly expressed by the endothelium and is responsible for a critical enzymatic step in the generation of angiotensin II. However, the functional contribution of ACE expression in the vascular wall in atherogenesis is unknown. Therefore, we made use of unique genetic models in which mice without expression of ACE in the vascular wall were crossed with apoE-/- mice in order to determine the contribution of tissue ACE expression to atherosclerotic lesion formation.\nMethods and Results\nMice expressing either a soluble form of ACE (ACE 2/2) or mice with somatic ACE expression restricted to the liver and kidney (ACE 3/3) on an ApoE-/- background were placed on a standard chow or Western diet for 6 months. Atherosclerotic lesion area in the ACE 2/2 mice was significantly lower than that seen in the ACE 3/3 mice. However, these animals also had significantly lower blood pressure and reduced plasma ACE activity which precluded establishing a specific causal relationship between absent tissue ACE activity and decreased atherosclerotic lesion extent. Therefore, we studied the ACE 3/3 mice which are normotensive and lack vascular ACE expression. In the ACE 3/3 animals, atherosclerotic lesion area was no different from wild type controls despite reduced plasma ACE activity.\nWe concluded that under these experimental conditions, expression of ACE in the arterial wall is not required for atherosclerotic lesion formation.\nangiotensin; atherosclerosis; endothelium\nWe report the first use of ultrasonic standing waves to achieve cell cycle phase synchronization in mammalian cells in a high-throughput and reagent-free manner. The acoustophoretic cell synchronization (ACS) device utilizes volume-dependent acoustic radiation force within a microchannel to selectively purify target cells of desired phase from an asynchronous mixture based on cell cycle-dependent fluctuations in size. We show that ultrasonic separation allows for gentle, scalable and label-free synchronization with high G1 phase synchrony (~84%) and throughput (3\u00d7106 cells/hour/microchannel).\nSample preparation is often the most tedious and demanding step in an assay, but it also plays an essential role in determining the quality of results. As biological questions and analytical methods become increasingly sophisticated, there is a rapidly growing need for systems that can reliably and reproducibly separate cells and particles with high purity, throughput and recovery. Microfluidics technology represents a compelling approach in this regard, allowing precise control of separation forces for high performance separation in inexpensive, or even disposable, devices. In addition, microfluidics technology enables the fabrication of arrayed and integrated systems that operate either in parallel or in tandem, in a capacity that would be difficult to achieve in macro-scale systems. In this report, we use recent examples from our work to illustrate the potential of microfluidic cell- and particle-sorting devices. We demonstrate the potential of chip-based high-gradient magnetophoresis that enable high-purity separation through reversible trapping of target particles paired with high-stringency washing with minimal loss. We also describe our work in the development of devices that perform simultaneous multi-target sorting, either through precise control of magnetic and fluidic forces or through the integration of multiple actuation forces into a single monolithic device. We believe that such devices may serve as a powerful \u201cfront-end\u201d module of highly integrated analytical platforms capable of providing actionable diagnostic information directly from crude, unprocessed samples - the success of such systems may hold the key to advancing point-of-care diagnostics and personalized medicine.\nSample preparation; Cell sorting; Magnetophoresis; Microfluidics\nHyperparathyroidism in humans and continuous parathyroid hormone (cPTH) treatment in mice cause bone loss by regulating the production of RANKL and OPG by stromal cells (SCs) and osteoblasts (OBs). Recently, it has been reported that T cells are required for cPTH to induce bone loss as the binding of the T cell costimulatory molecule CD40L to SC receptor CD40 augments SC sensitivity to cPTH. However it is unknown whether direct PTH stimulation of T cells is required for cPTH to induce bone loss, and whether T cells contribute to the bone catabolic activity of PTH with mechanisms other than induction of CD40 signaling in SCs.\nHere we show that silencing of PTH receptor 1 (PPR) in T cells blocks the bone loss and the osteoclastic expansion induced by cPTH, thus demonstrating that PPR signaling in T cells is central for PTH-induced reduction of bone mass. Mechanistic studies revealed that PTH activation of the T cell PPR stimulates T cell production of the osteoclastogenic cytokine tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF). Attesting to the relevance of this effect, disruption of T cell TNF production prevents PTH-induced bone loss. We also show that a novel mechanism by which TNF mediates PTH induced osteoclast formation is upregulation of CD40 expression in SCs, which increases their RANKL/OPG production ratio.\nThese findings demonstrate that PPR signaling in T cells plays an essential role in PTH induced bone loss by promoting T cell production of TNF. A previously unknown effect of TNF is to increase SC expression of CD40, which in turn increases SC osteoclastogenic activity by upregulating their RANKL/OPG production ratio. PPR-dependent stimulation of TNF production by T cells and the resulting TNF regulation of CD40 s", "Principal Proposed Natural Treatments\nWho among us has never had a nosebleed? Whether a dab of blood on a tissue or a terrifying flood, a nosebleed can arise from many causes: dry winter air, colds, injuries, or the common if unsavory habit of picking one's nose. In many cases, no cause can be identified with certainty.\nSometimes nosebleeds arise more frequently because of faulty or weak collagen , a strengthening protein present in blood vessel walls and the surrounding connective tissue. Collagen problems may lead to nosebleeds in people who take corticosteroids and those with a condition called \"fragile capillaries.\" Corticosteroids, including nasal steroids used for allergies, can thin the collagen in the mucous membranes lining the nose. In fragile capillaries, weak or defective collagen in blood vessel walls may contribute to bleeding. People with such collagen problems may have problems with bleeding gums, heavy menstrual periods, and bruising in addition to nosebleeds.\nRarely, the cause of nosebleeds and other bleeding lies in the blood itself. Anything that reduces blood clotting may lead to nosebleeds. Drugs such as warfarin (Coumadin) or heparin , or regular use of aspirin, decrease the blood's tendency to clot. Caution : if you are taking such medications and begin to experience nosebleeds, talk to your doctor. Even natural substances such as ginkgo , policosanol , high-dose vitamin E , and garlic may increase the tendency to bleed.\nConventional treatments for nosebleeds include various maneuvers for stopping acute bleeding, followed by the diagnosis and treatment of any underlying problems. Sometimes a physician can prevent future noseb", "formance truck competition where testing weeds out lesser trucks and the best of the best rise to the top.

There's no realistic financial path forward for him.\nLet's stipulate the following: no one can predict the future. But when the Mets were in fourth place on September 1 of last year, 13 games out, no one treated it like a coin flip whether they'd make the playoffs or not.

With losses expected to be $70 million this year, a $22 million debt balloon payment due on Citi Field in June, and $25 million due back to Major League Baseball by the end of the season, that leaves around $85 million over, assuming no other expenses, planning for 2012 losses, or the next debt balloon payment on Citi Field.\nBut let's say the Wilpons hold onto that entire $85 million, and apply it toward the lawsuit they face from the Trustee for the Bernie Madoff victims, Irving Picard.\nPicard wants $1 billion.
