In a statement released Thursday, local industry group Nasscom said labs in the country will now gain global recognition. In addition, products tested will be accepted by countries participating in the \"Common Criteria - Recognition Arrangement\" (CCRA) scheme. These members include Australia, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, and the United States.\nNasscom also noted the CCRA nod would ensure investments and efforts made in India by global companies in product-testing certification will be recognized by other countries. \"Authorizing nation status will remove the bottleneck which, as of now, prevents submitting of products for testing in India,\" it said.\nCommon criteria offers assurance that the implementation and evaluation of an ICT product has been conducted in rigorous, standards-based, and repeatable manner.\nIndia's CCRA recognition also will allow the country to create", "Regulatory requirements for extractables and leachables studies cross multiple markets including Pharmaceuticals, Cosmetics, and Medical Devices.

Throughout his long career he has worked in the Ion Chromatography, Polymer and Pharmaceutical applications laboratories. In 2011 he became Senior Market Development Manager for the Americas Chemical Materials team focusing on the polymer, fine and specialty chemicals, and energy markets.\n|Tammy Argentine, Chemistry Specialist, Waters Corporation\nTammy joined Waters as a Chemistry Specialist for the Midwest Region in 2006. For over 25 years she has focused on the science & promotion of chromatography products. Tammy's expert command of solid phase extraction and LC separation applications is an asset much relied on by her clients & colleagues. Tammy earned a BS degree in Chemistry from Illinois State University in Normal, IL a Masters in Business Administration from the Lake Forest Graduate School of Management in Lake Forest, IL and an MS degree in Biotechnology & Chemical Science from Roosevelt University in Chicago, IL.\nLCMS Method Development for the Analysis of E & L Compounds\nDeveloping an LC method requires a series of experiments to determine the best and most effective separation conditions. A method development strategy that is systematic in its approach can greatly simplify the process and allow the scientist to develop optimal separation conditions efficiently. In this seminar we describe a full factorial approach to screening 2 solvent systems & 5 columns to develop an E & L UPLC TQMS method. Results are shown for both an E & L standard and an extracted LDPE ophthalmic bottle. Conversion of the resultant UPLC method to an HPLC column & system for routine QC analysis is then described.\n|Baiba Cabovska, PhD, Business Development Manager, Chemical Materials, Waters Corporation\nBaiba joined Waters in Milford, MA as a Senior Applicat", "What are some tips given in the text for encouraging women to take the initiative in sexual relationships", "What recognition has India obtained regarding IT products testing, and what benefits will it bring", "I want to go back to fully stock stock phone.

Baiba transitioned to a Business Development role for the Chemical Materials team in 2016, where she leads the E & L program. Prior to joining Waters, Baiba spent 5 years at Mannkind Corporation, where her responsibilities included E & L analysis for a dry powder inhaler device.\nUNIFI/QTof Screening Workflow for Confirming & Identifying Extractables\nCharacterization of packaging, food contact materials, medical devices and many other consumables used in various industries is becoming more and more important due to ever increasing global regulations. The initial step in characterizing extractables from packaging includes targeted screening, i.e. testing the extracts for known compounds. This is a well-established process and is performed using a variety of analytical techniques ranging from GC-FID-MS to LC-UV-MS. However, the final packaging may also include impurities present in the starting materials or degradants formed during the molding process. The structural elucidation of these unknowns is typically a very complex and time consuming process, requiring significant expertise. The UNIFI/QTof Screening Solution provides a simple workflow that includes scientific library creation, multivariate statistical analysis, elucidation and reporting. The single platform informatics solution aids analysts in the evaluation of complex data by simplifying data review and facilitating the decision making process.\n|GUEST SPEAKER: Jianfeng Hong, Fresenius Kabi USA, Lake Zurich, IL\nJianfeng Hong is a Senior Research Scientist and the manager of the Analytical Chemistry laboratory at Fresenius Kabi, USA (FK) in Lake Zurich, IL. In this role, he leads a group of analytical chemists studying the extractable and leachable profiles of materials used in FK's blood separation/storage devices and IV pharmaceutical products. His group employs a wide variety of advanced analytical instrumentation including GC/MS, UPLC/UV, Q-TOF High Resolution/Accurate Mass MS, APGC/MS and ICP/MS.

A photographer could wait for hours before suitable subjects showed up.\nI suspect strongly that the photo was staged, and the cyclists were recruited for the photo shoot. The Green Lane Project would then carry some responsibility for their actions, and not only for the choice of the photo.\nAs is typical of Green Lane Project work, the photo is carefully framed to, well, create an impression. It is said that the camera doesn\u2019t lie, but on the other hand, perspective can play tricks. What looks like a continuous wall at the right side of the photo is actually a line of widely spaced flexible barrier posts, as is clear in the Street View image below, which also shows a treebox on the sidewalk. It is filled to the brim, though the photo was taken in midsummer.\nThe video of one of my own rides on this street is posted below. I am riding northbound \u2014 in the opposite direction of Keri\u2019s ride in the earlier video \u2014 and Keri is behind me, shooting video with her helmet camera. At 3:37, a pedestrian walks out between flex posts into my path. At 4:40, there\u2019s a conflict with oncoming bicycle traffic. Both these situations required me to slow abruptly. There are several left-hook conflicts and a couple of oncoming right-cross threats.\nWe cross T street at 11:47 in the video. Total time from H street to V street was 14 minutes, 31 seconds for an average speed of 5.1 miles per hour. Waiting time was 5 minutes 21 seconds. The traffic light timing was more favorable, but this direction is slightly uphill. 15th Street Cycletrack at Rush Hour from Keri Caffrey on Vimeo.\nWhile young children and novice cyclists aren\u2019t safe on a busy street, it\u2019s certainly fair to ask whether they are safe on this bikeway, considering that it wasn\u2019t safe for me.\nDuring rush hour, major intersections on the bikeway descend into chaos, as shown in another of Keri Caffrey\u2019s videos.\nAre there better alternatives? Yes, in education and in infrastructure choices, among other things, but they require a bolder, broader, more knowledgeable and more flexible approach than we see here.\nOne more comment about the cyclists in the video: as I\u2019ve made clear elsewhere, I strongly advocate helmet use, but I don\u2019t promote mandatory helmet laws. Lacking near-universal acceptance of helmet use, such laws can do more harm than good, in my opinion. I give my reasons for that in another article.\nOn the other hand, as my good friend Sheldon Brown liked to say, a parent who puts a helmet on his child but doesn\u2019t wear one himself is offering the example \u201cdo as I say, not as I do,\u201d and unnecessarily risks leaving the child an orphan.\nFinally: As I noted in my previous post, someone at Momentum Magazine deleted comments I left on its blog. The comments were as polite as these, but much shorter. The author of the Momentum Magazine article, Managing Editor Duncan Hurd, commented on my previous post, suggesting a dialog by e-mail. I responded saying that I welcomed a dialog. The only more recent communication I have had from him is a second comment describing my observations as \u201cconcern trolling.\u201d\nMy friend Khalil Spencer posted comments on the Momentum Magazine article later, and those too were deleted.

Create offers they can\u2019t refuse.\nReally want to get more subscribers? Then, make them an offer they can\u2019t refuse. In exchange for their email, give them access to a free eBook or white paper, enter them into a giveaway or contest, or send them handy tools that can make their job easier or simpler. Make that offer as enticing as possible!\n3. Add a sign-up to your email signature.\nHow many people do you email in a week? A month? A year? Probably hundreds, maybe even thousands, right? Take advantage of all that exposure, and promote your newsletter sign-up in your signature. Sure, not everyone is going to take the bite and subscribe, but you might as well try, right?\n4. Have a sign-up sheet at your next event.\nIf you regularly attend trade shows or host events at your company, consider working an email sign-up sheet into your booth or presentation. Encourage anyone who stops by or inquires about your brand to sign up. Then, put them on a specialty email list, and send them targeted content designed to convert.\n5.

William Leonard, the nation's top classification oversight official from 2002-2007, concurred.\n\"The disappointment I feel with respect to the abuse of the classification system in this instance is profound,\" said Mr. Leonard, who recently retired as director of the Information Security Oversight Office, which reports to the President on classification and declassification policy.\n\"The document in question is purely a legal analysis,\" he said, and it contains \"nothing which would justify classification.\"\nBeyond that crucial fact, the binding technical requirements of classification were ignored.\nThus, he explained: There were no portion markings, identifying which paragraphs were classified at what level. The original classifier was not identified on the cover page by name or position. The duration of classification was not given. A concise basis for classification was not specified. Yet all of these are explicitly required by the President's executive order on classification.\n\"It is not even apparent that [John] Yoo [who authored the memo] had original classification authority,\" Mr. Leonard said.\n\"All too often, government officials simply assert classification. To enjoy the legal safeguards of the classification system, you need to do more than that. Those basic, elemental steps were not followed in this instance.\"\n\"Also, for the Department of Defense to declassify a Department of Justice document,\" as in this case, \"is highly irregular,\" Mr. Leonard said.\n(The DoD declassifier mistakenly cited \"Executive Order 1958\" on the cover page of the declassified memorandum. The correct citation is \"Executive Order 12958, as amended.\")\nViolations of classification policy pale in comparison to the policy deviations authorized by the Justice Department memo, which was ultimately rescinded. Nevertheless, such classification violations are significant because they enabled the Administration to pursue its interrogation policies without independent scrutiny or accountability.\n\"To learn that such a document is classified has the same effect for me as waking up o", "BASF and Dow, will gather at the forum to put their heads together, share visionary perspectives on energy and delve into the development prospects and latest advances of clean energy.

He said CU coaches are getting a mature player who has been through the fire.\n\"He basically has one year of starting under his belt, and I think right now he's a young man who will begin to come in to his own in the next couple years,\" Long said. \"He's poised and ready to take it to the next step. That was kind of the path we had him on. I know he's in good hands with the coaching staff there. I think you will see Jordan blossom.\"\nLong left Kansas after last season when head coach Turner Gill was fired after going 5-19 in two seasons at the helm of a program that played in a BCS bowl game in the 2007 season. Webb played in many of those games over the two years under Gill and Long and brings much more experience to the table than any of the young quarterbacks on the CU roster, even though it's losing experience.\nWebb will be able to compete for the starting job when fall camp opens Aug. 7 because he earned his degree at KU, making him eligible under NCAA rules without having to sit out a year. He has two years of eligibility remaining.\nWebb said he had to pass 28 credit hours between January and the end of June to graduate and give himself a chance to play for the Buffs. It doesn't surprise Long that Webb found a way to make it happen.\n\"He will make the position very competitive,\" Long said.\nLong said when Webb first joined the Kansas program out of high school in St. Louis, it took him awhile to learn to become a student of the game and to take all of his coaching to heart. Long said Webb made drastic improvements in those areas over the past two years.\nWebb completed 179 of 281 passes for 1,884 yards and 13 touchdowns with 12 interceptions last year. He has thrown 20 touchdowns and 20 interceptions to this point in his career, a fact that raised some skeptical eyebrows from CU fans who questioned why coach Jon Embree wanted add Webb to the roster.\nLong said Webb's high interception numbers at KU are the result of multiple factors. He said Webb never learned to throw the ball away in high school and it took him awhile to get used to the idea that it's OK to do so at the college level. He said Webb's competitive spirit sometimes led him to make poor decisions trying to make plays with his team often trailing by large deficits. And Long said mistakes by teammates and good plays by defenders also contributed to Webb's interception totals.\n\"He had to learn to play smarter,\" Long said. \"Quarterbacking is situat", "by Mercedes Morgan.

For the first time in the tournament, South Africa are behind. They continue to push forward, but too often they find themselves playing the wrong ball and running down blind alleys. Uruguay, meanwhile, drop players behind the ball and play on the break. Luis Suarez hits the side netting when should maybe have done a little better. They are, however, doing enough \u2013 more than enough \u2013 to hold on as half-time comes.\nSouth Africa need a strong start to the second half, but they play the opening ten minutes as if somebody has spiked their half-time oranges with mogadon. Sluggish and careless in possession and sloppy with their marking, they allow Uruguay far too much control in the centre of the pitch. Suarez crosses and Cavani sees his shot blocked from six yards out. Lugano has a free header but makes a hash of his jump and sees the ball bounce off the top of his back and away. South Africa bite back with their best spell of possession of the match but \u2013 and this happens so often that it starts to become almost infuriating to watch \u2013 every time they to cross, shoot, pass\u2026 anything, it is blocked by a white-shirted player.\nThen, with fifteen minutes to play, falls the hammer blow. From nowhere, Luis Suarez springs the offside trap and is tripped by the South African goalkeeper Itumelenge Khune. At first view, there is a \u2013 soon disproved \u2013 hint of offside about the ball that released him, but there is no lingering doubt about it. Khune is sent off and, after a lengthy delay while South Africa replace Pienaar with the reserve goalkeeper, Moeneeb Josephs, Diego Forlan slams the penalty kick into the roof of the net to double the Uruguayan lead. It is the goal that fatally deflates the South African balloon. They have created scarcely any chances for the previous eighty-odd minutes with eleven men. Quite where they can realistically hope to get two goals from in around ten minutes is anybody\u2019s guess, and so it proves. Uruguay run down the clock with considerable comfort, and in the dying seconds comes the icing on the cake. Forlan\u2019s superb diagonal pass picks out Luis Suarez on the right hand side, and Suarez lifts the ball back across the goal for Alvaro Pereira to touch the ball over the line for 3-0.\nSouth Africa remain in the competition by the width of a cigarette paper. Should they beat France next week and other results go their way they can still edge through, but blind hope is about as much as they have now and on the evidence of tonight\u2019s performance they simply won\u2019t have enough to edge through. In the World Cup, though, tonight has been Uruguay\u2019s night. We have seen this evening the first individual performance of real quality from Diego Forlan, and his team deserves absolute credit for coming into such a hostile atmosphere and taking such complete control of the game. Providing they don\u2019t crash and burn against Mexico, they will completely deserve their place in the Second Round of the competition. Eighty years after they won the first World Cup, they have started this tournament solidly and, in a tournament in which the possibility of no team shining as brightly as had been predicted before a ball was kicked hasn\u2019t yet been disavowed, they may well consider that their chances of going further than anybody had predicted are high.\nOur thanks once more to Historical Football Kits for the use of their images in this match report.", "What event are thousands of cyclists attending at Laguna Seca Raceway", "Poker.

It marks the anniversary of the start of the 1976 Soweto riots, which began with the death of twenty-three people after the police opened fire on a protest in the township against the imposition of Arikaans in schools. The events of that day caused revulsion around the world \u2013 prompted in no small part by a horrific photograph of a dying child, twelve year-old Hector Pieterson, which flashed around the world \u2013 and sparked the consciences of many millions of people. It took almost two decades, but apartheid began to die that day. The ultimate sacrifice of those that died on the 16th of June 1976 (as well as many more before and afterwards) would lead to the freedom and salvation of the country.\nIt is, therefore, utterly appropriate that the South African national team should play today, that football, the game of the oppressed under that wretched regime, should take the centre stage on this of all days. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the atmosphere at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria is thunderous. The South African team sing in the tunnel before the match, and the South African National Anthem rushes out of the speakers on the television. Seldom can it have been sung with such pride and such conviction. But can South Africa, who have the mother of home advantages this evening, make the most of this opportunity?\nTo an extent, it\u2019s difficult not to have a degree of sympathy for Uruguay this evening. Only Uruguayans themselves or the stone-hearted could want them to win this evening. They are battling enormous odds, having already caused something of a surprise by grinding out a draw in their opening match against France last week. Indeed, this is a match of many questions. After a tepid opening round of matches, will teams come out of their shells as winning starts to become more important than not losing? To an extent, this match, the first of the second round of group matches, will act as something of a barometer for the next few days. With the group all square after one match, defeat for either team could mark the beginning of the end of their involvement. South Africa will need no reminding that no host nation has ever been eliminated at the first stage of the World Cup finals.\nIt\u2019s cold again, of course. That this should be a major surprise to major broadcasters when we were all aware that it is the middle of winter in South Africa (which is, of course, the southernmost tip of Africa and therefore nearer to the South Pole than anywhere else on the continent) says more about the preparation of the broadcasters themselves than it ever could about the weather. Uruguay dominate the first fifteen minutes without attempting much like a serious attempt on goal, and the feeling that the players know how important this is crackles in the air. Three minutes in, Uruguay win a free-kick on the edge of the South African penalty area and Stephen Pienaar is booked for encroaching to block Diego Forlan\u2019s shot. By the time that the retake has also been blocked, it has been three minutes since the original foul was committed.\nSlowly, though, South Africa settle. It is on the break that they look to be at their most effervescent, and Siphiwe Tshabalala shoots over from distance twice. We are midway through the first half before Luis Suarez has the first shot on target of the match, but within a minute of this Uruguay have the lead when Forlan\u2019s powerful long rang shot defle", "What illnesses is Becca Mueller battling and what treatments has she undergone", "Dangers of Commercial Horse Feeds\nWhilst there is no doubt that fresh spring and summer grass contains natural sugars produced by the grass this is a far cry from the large amounts of refined and processed molasses and \"sugar derivatives\" included in commercial equine feeds to increase palatibility. In some cases this can amount to nearly 50% of the feed. So-called \"lite\" varieties still contain significant amounts of molasses and are completely contra-indicated for horses and ponies at risk of or suffering from laminitis. High molasses/sugar levels have 3 advantages for the manufacturer -\n- Horses eat up to 40% more food = increased profits = poorer owner\n- It covers the taste of the low grade ingredients used to maximise profits\n- It creates hard food addicts. This creates repeat business.\nIf you don't believe me on this addict point why\nelse do all the horses on the yard kick the door at feed time even if\nthere is forage available?\nAnswer: They want their fix.\nUnfortunately there are other downsides beyond your continuing expense on hard feed. Your horse/pony is likely to get fat as it will continue to eat more than it would otherwise do. This can put strains on the liver, heart and other organs and will predispose to disease of these organs including laminitis, Cushings, bleeders, tying up and even diabetes.\nIf too much hard feed is fed too early in life (this includes during pregnancy as a foetus), growth can occur too quickly and joints especially will struggle to cope and predispose to problems such as OsteoChondritis Dessicans (OCD) and Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD).

See product page for more details.\nUnlike ruminants such as sheep, cows and goats which have a 4-chambered stomach called a rumen where plant fermentation takes place, equines have a very large hind-gut - the large colon - where bacteria ferment the plant material in order to release plant nutrients. Even natural simple plant sugars are released slowly as cell walls need to be broken down to release it. This means that energy is usually released on a fairly continual basis.

While the monster fish captures headlines as it inches toward the Great Lakes, other species have already colonized other parts of the country, and are costing plenty of money to control. A finance website has totaled up the toll, listing \"10 Invasive Species That Cost the U.S. a Bundle.\" See if you agree, disagree, or are just surprised by some of the choices. It's always interesting when environmental issues are broken down into dollars and cents. When animals get in the way of people, sometimes the first reaction is to remove the animals from the equation, even with native species like the double-crested cormorant.\nThe cormorant didn't make this Top Ten list, from Daily Finance, an AOL site. The site based its list on animals and insects that were introduced by humans to correct an imbalance, and species that were once endangered but grew \"out of control due to the efforts of concerned scientists and environmentalists to protect them.\" The list, and why the animal or insect is considered costly:\n1.

What happens if the market crashes instead? No worries. Your prediction will already be forgotten.

He is participating in player organized throwing sessions and 7-on-7. He said one of the big early adjustments has been getting used to Nike balls after spending three years in Kansas throwing Wilson balls.\nWebb said some of his interceptions at Kansas were fluky, but he acknowledges he has to do a better job of taking care of the ball if he hopes to earn the starting job with the Buffs. One of the primary reasons CU coaches chose Tyler Hansen as their starter last season was because he didn't throw interceptions during scrimmages in spring and fall camp.\n\"That's the number one job of the quarterback,\" Webb said. \"If you're not able to take care of the ball, you're probably not going to be playing too long. If you look back on the (2011) stats, I don't think I threw my first interception until the fourth game. It's hard to say that's the number one thing I'm working on because I'm working on everything, but decision making is obviously up there.\"\nWebb played in a spread offense at Kansas and was asked to run the ball at times. He said the CU pro style offense is very different from a formation and terminology standpoint, but there are concepts and routes within the scheme that are essentially the same.\nHe said his biggest challenge between now and the time camp opens and the competition starts is learning the offense. He doesn't want coaches to have to dumb down the offense when he's taking repetitions. Webb said Colorado coaches have asked him to take a leadership role and be assertive.\nSo, considering Webb has played in 21 college games with more than a dozen starts and only one other CU quarterback has college experience (sophomore Nick Hirschman), shouldn't he be the starter?\n\"I would like to think that would be the case, but nothing has been guaranteed to me,\" Webb said. \"What it's going to come down to is that fall camp and having a grasp of the offense, taking control in the huddle and really asserting myself as a leader.\"\nLong isn't making any predictions because he doesn't know a lot about the other quarterbacks on Colorado's roster, but he does believe that Webb's experience and the fact that the other Buffs are still wet behind the ears favors Webb.\n\"He's very tough,\" Long said. \"He's one of the tougher guys that I've coached.

Poker is one of those rare sports that can be convivial as well as competitive however, and that's what our home games are all about. Yes, we play for money, but making money isn't the sole reason we play (which is just as well as far as I'm concerned). I would say that the majority of us play poker to become better at the game, to have a good time, and (perhaps most importantly) to get out of the door quick enough that we don't have to help with the tidying up!\n....just because the stakes are small doesn't mean the quality of play has to suffer.

The man has a shopping bag hanging from the handlebar where it can swing into the spokes of the front wheel. The shopping bag and possible hazards under the leaves carry the risk of a front-wheel-stopping crash, with the cyclist pivoting forward and landing on his head.\nThe photo appeared in Momentum Magazine, and was provided by the Green Lane Project, an organization funded by bicycle manufacturers and which promotes the construction of barrier-separated on-street bikeways. I commented on the photo in an earlier post, and said that I\u2019d return to the topic, because I recognized the location. So, here I am.\nIt is 15th Street and T street in Washington, DC, USA. Here\u2019s a Google Street View from a couple of years ago. Some different traffic signs have been installed since then, and yellow flex posts have replaced white ones, but the tree with white bark is unmistakable. The pinkish building in the background of both images is three blocks away, at W street.\nThe cyclists\u2019 riding side by side gives the impression that the bikeway is one-way, but actually it is two-way, as the Street View photo shows. Leaves and trash cover the lane lines in the Green Lane photo.\nWhat is it really like to ride this bikeway? In the video embedded below, my friend Keri Caffrey rides in the same direction as the cyclists in the Green Lane photo, also at a time of light traffic. Keri reaches T street at 1:11 in the video. She rides all the way down to H street, and obeys the traffic signals.\nAbout half the time, she is waiting for the signals, and so her average travel speed is 4.5 miles per hour. Most of this street is one-way, the traffic lights are timed for traffic in the other direction, and cyclists have only a short interval to cross legally, because turning traffic has a dedicated signal phase. Nonetheless, Keri encounters some turning and crossing conflicts. Other cyclists in the video can\u2019t be bothered to wait for the signals.\nWhy are the leaves in the street? Washington, DC has information on leaf collection, instructing residents to place leaves in treeboxes (between sidewalk and curb) rather than in the street, and acknowledging problems with leaf pickup due to weather conditions. As the trees are at the curb, nearly half the leaves fall directly into the street. The sidewalk extends all the way to the curb and there is very little space around trees to store the leaves they drop. Without a barrier-separated bikeway, nobody would have to use space next to the curb as travel space.\nThe message of the Momentum Magazine article is \u201cbetter biking,\u201d and by implication, safe cycling even for children and novice cyclists, thanks to barrier-separated bikeways. One of the cyclists in the Green Lane Project photo is a young child, who, to be sure, wouldn\u2019t be safe riding on streets with fast or heavy motor traffic. The other cyclist is an adult, but his choice to hang a bag over the handlebar speaks volumes about his skill level.\nOr was that his own choice?

Coax her. Tempt her. Tease her as if she were a cat chasing a feather on a string, advise our experts. Give her a deep, sigh-inducing kiss\u2014then stop. Or pull her close, press tight against her thigh, then move away.\n\"You're letting her know you're open to her advance but making her bring it to the next level of intimacy,\" says Amy Levine, a New York City based sexuality educator. Once she's comfortable making the moves, she'll be more likely to pounce when the urge strikes.\nStoke the Home Fires\nUnleash your inner Emeril and you'll nail the top two mood-boosters for women. \"When you cook for somebody, it says, 'You're worth my time,' and that's the biggest turn-on of all,\" says Martha Hopkins, author of Intercourses: An Aphrodisiac Cookbook.\nOur advice: Whip up an easy appetizer, not a five-course meal. A simple asparagus-and-prosciutto dish\u2014saut\u00e9 the stalks in olive oil for 3 minutes, wrap with prosciutto, sprinkle on goat cheese and pine nuts\u2014is packed with zinc, a key mineral needed for maintaining erections.\nFollow with a chocolate dessert and you'll load up on phenylethylamine, a neurotransmitter that activates the brain's pleasure center, and caffeine, which can jolt sex drive.\nDance Her Pants Off\nHome cooking not cutting it? \"Take her ironic dancing,\" suggests Nicole Beland, the Men's Health Girl Next Door. Go somewhere ridiculous: senior night at a ballroom-dancing club; line dancing, if you both hate country music; a '70s disco joint; an '80s club playing a sickening mix of Dee-Lite, Salt-N-Pepa, and George Michael. \"Dancing really well at any of these places would actually be more embarrassing than if you just did the robot,\" says Beland. \"The two of you will goof around, make fun of everyone else, and end up having an amazing time.\"\nShe's a serious dancer?

But will she say yes? Make this your litmus test.\n1. Graze her thigh. As you flirt, stand or sit within 6 inches of her. If she seems unruffled, move closer. Eventually you want your thigh to be pressed against hers, whether you're standing or sitting. If she's into it, move on to step two, says Beland. If she squirms, back off.\n2. Plant one, already. A make-out session is a prerequisite to a sexual proposition, says Beland. Pay attention to how intensely she's kissing back. You want the \"I want to eat you alive, starting with your head\" kind of kiss, not the sweet little \"I'm not really a dirty girl\" kind of kiss.\n3. Pop the question. Your approach can be either funny (\"So, what do you say we go back to my place for milkshakes and Jenga?\"); hesitant and humble (\"I don't even know how to ask you this, but I would really love to be alone with you\"); or straightforward and sweet (\"Please, God, tell me that we can go home together\"). Dial back the sleaze factor and, \"chances are, if she's been shoving her tongue down your throat, any one of them could probably end up working,\" says Beland.\nFollow Her Lead\nForeplay can be a fact-finding mission, not just a necessary evil. Syncing the way you communicate in bed\u2014verbally and nonverbally\u2014will rev her engines more quickly, says Brian Mustanski, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nHe suggests a technique called \"sensate focus\": \"During foreplay, agree that the genitals are off limits. Touch the other parts of her body, using fingers, a feather, a silk scarf, or anything that turns her on, and ask her to describe how it feels,\" he says. Watch and listen for nonverbal clues, too\u2014moans, thrusts, gasps. Work her hot spots properly and she'll be begging to move to the main event, in which you'll watch for those same signals. The better you're able to read her, the more likely you'll reach a happy ending.\nScore Before Breakfast\nThe hard sell seldom works. Here's how to heat her up before your waffle pops.\n1. Wake up earlier. \"A woman won't want sex if she feels hurried,\" says Nagoski. \"Her clitoris won't respond to even the most skilled touch if she's worried about being late for work. And besides, she needs about 20 minutes to reach orgasm, anyway.\" Set the alarm early or, better yet, make your move on the weekend to ensure that she's relaxed and responsive.\n2. Whisper, don't poke. Women need aural stimulation to help kill self-consciousness about eye boogers and bed head, says Nagoski. So pull her close and sa", "rently.

Bring her some OJ. Juice masks morning breath, and \"the citrus will jumpstart her arousal system,\" says Alan Hirsch, M.D., director of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation, in Chicago. Bonus: Vitamin C boosts your adrenaline, giving you extra stamina. She'll appreciate that.\nFind Your Rhythm\nDon't sell yourself short. \"Every guy I've ever, um, known has confessed that he didn't think his penis size was anything to write home about,\" says Beland. \"But they were all perfectly well hung.\"\nMake the most of what you have by using powerful, deep thrusts at a slow-to-medium pace. \"It can be wonderfully intense. Pistonlike porno thrusting feels horrible. It can leave a girl dry, sore, and bored,\" she says. Add side-to-side movement, or up-and-down pelvic pressure against her clitoris when you're all the way inside, to vary the stimulation.\nKiss Better Below\n\"Being too rough\" is the worst mistake men make during oral sex, the ladies said. \"Guys think they need to thrust and flick,\" says Ian Kerner, Ph.D., a New York City\u2013based sex therapist and the author of She Comes First. \"But often what she wants is a firm, still tongue\u2014a point of pressure\u2014so she can set the rhythm and pace.\"\nAnother trick: Ask her to kiss your earlobe with the same pressure she prefers during oral, then cop her style next time you're south of the border.\nMake a Bigger Bang\nThinking about baseball or the weather tends to kill the moment entirely, and the oft-cited stop-start technique can leave her hanging. Instead, try thinking about other ways of pleasuring her, says Mustanski.\nWhen you feel your point of no return approaching\u2014it's technically called \"ejaculatory inevitability\"\u2014treat it as a cue to start stimulating her in a different way. Massage her clitoris with your fingers. Or, while inside her, press against it with the part of your abdomen just above your penis. Or stop and give her oral for a while.\n\"If you're smooth, she'll have no idea you're just trying to regulate your ejaculation,\" says Mustanski. \"But all you have to do is let your system settle from its excited point.\"\nUnleash Her Wild Side\nSexual experimentation is earned, not inherited. Unless you're dating a dominatrix, it requires time, tact, and trust: 66 percent of the women we surveyed said they're most willing to experiment later in a relationship.\nHow can you put yourself on the fast track? \"Make her feel like she won't be judged,\" says Candida Royalle, an erotic-film producer and the author of How to Tell a Naked Man What to Do. \"There's the whole 'slut' complex you have to get past.\" Here's a three-step plan for jumpstarting her wildest desires.\n1. Plant the seed. The best erotic icebreaker? The written word. \"Women like the story aspect of porn,\" says Patti Britton, Ph.D., author of The Art of Sex Coaching. \"But sometimes pornography can be too shocking.\" A softer touch: Fuel her imagination by slipping a bookmark into a sexy scene in a classic, classy novel\u2014The Garden of Eden, by Ernest Hemingway, say, or something contemporary like The Time Traveler's Wife, by Audrey Niffenegger.\n2. Feel her out. Introduce the idea indirectly. Add a steamy, woman-friendly film to your Netflix queue\u2014In the Cut, The Thomas Crown Affair (the newer one), or our favorite, A History of Violence\u2014and use the sex scene as a conversation catalyst. Or reference something sexy you saw in a magazine (such as this very article), Royalle suggests. \"That way, you can ask your partner, 'Did you ever think of doing that?' without pointedly saying, 'This is what I want.'\"\n3. Start tame. Come to bed in buttless chaps and a ball gag and, chances are, you'll spend the night alone. Try pubic grooming as a starter kit for kink: More than 67 percent of women we surveyed said they'd be up for a trim, if asked (and 55 percent have gone completely bare at least once). \"It helps pave the way for more playful experimentation,\" says Royalle, who suggests offering to let her trim you first. (Ninety-five percent of men said they'd be up for a trim.)\nWatch and Learn\nMasturbation isn't just her release valve; it's your sex school\u2014if she'll let you watch. \"It's very intimate, but it is important for her to share what she likes,\" says Melinda Gallagher, cofounder of the women's sexual empowerment group CAKE and coauthor of A Piece of CAKE: Recipes for Female Sexual Pleasure.\nLower the stage-fright factor by encouraging her to guide your hands. Once she's okay with sharing, Gallagher says, she might be willing to start a toy box\u2014or pry open the one she's been hiding from you. No toys? Log on. \"Shopping together lets you talk about your fantasies and your limits,\" says Nagoski. All without hitting the smut shop on Route 6.\nFulfill Her Every Fantasy\nRole playing means more than squeezing her into that old cheerleader outfit. \"A woman's sexual thoughts are kinky and creative,\" says Gallagher. \"Becoming someone else can unlock those desires.\" Translation: She'll be up for acting out her wildest fantasies. \"Some women like the rush of being swept away,\" says Gallagher.

Who enjoys meeting friends who look serious? Not any one of us.\nWhat about ourselves? Do we make happy friendships? Do we make our friends happy? Before thinking about others, wouldn\u2019t it be better if we first analyze our own selves? Do we smile more often when we are with our friends? Do we laugh at the smallest joke? Or do we have a serious expression on our face all the time with our friends? Let us first think about our own behavior and correct whatever we can.\nMaking happy friendships\nMake yourself look happy with your friends and your friends will reflect. That is the secret of happy friendship. Our emotions are reflected in our body language. The reverse is equally true. Does this help us? It does. It can change our state of mind by changing our physical state. For example, if you are feel"]}
