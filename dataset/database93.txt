Then, once the players were used to my way, when they knew how I wanted to do things, I was able to be sterner and get us going.\n\u201cIn the Varsity Shield success, the camaraderie of the UWC squad was evident and we went on to win the competition and, of course, seal promotion to the Varsity Cup. We won every game (last season) and gave away about five tries throughout.\n\u201cThe Varsity Cup will be a different story. There are other principles and aspects I will have to focus on, especially the technical and tactical side of the game. It will be our first year in the competition and, for us, it\u2019s a case of make or break. Essentially, though, we want to show that we rightfully deserve our place in the event.\n\u201cLooking at the schedule of games, we will be targeting a few teams. Our focus is to make sure we win at least three or four games. After that, we will have something to build on for the following year and can grow the team in that way.\n\u201cIt will be new to the players: Monday night rugby, a full stadium, and it\u2019s on television... They are not used to it, but we are arranging some high-profile friendlies \u2013 against WP, for example \u2013 to expose them to rugby at a higher level and under pressure to see how they respond.\u201d\nEvery coach, in any sport, has their own particular style, a firm grasp of how he wants his team to play. Williams is no different. Asked about the Varsity Cup, the former Springbok wing reveals just a smidgen of what to expect from UWC in the competition \u2013 and, just as importantly, uses the opportunity to emphasise his commitment to academic performance.\n\u201cObviously, I love players to have the ball in hand but I also want them to understand when and when not to do things,\u201d he says. \u201cLooking at the Varsity Cup, we will do our analysis and will have an approach for each and every opponent. It\u2019s not just a case of playing expansive rugby. Rather, it\u2019s about balance and allowing players to do things that come naturally.\n\u201cWhat is very important to me as a rugby coach is that players pass their grades. Talent is obviously important, but I\u2019m just as committed that students work hard academically. There has to be a balance between rugby and studies to be a player at UWC; it has to be handled properly.\u201d\nWilliams, needless to say, remains as passionate as ever about the Springboks \u2013 and, looking at the current squad, is optimistic about the future.\n\u201cUnder Rassie (Erasmus, Springbok coach), our rugby is looking better,\u201d he says. \u201cI think, with Rassie as a coach, the players understand their roles better and there is more consistency in selection. Results-wise, it\u2019s about the same as when Allister (Coetzee) was the coach, but there has been an improvement in the style of play, and Rassie is dealing very well with the players too.\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that the Springboks will be among the contenders for the World Cup.\u201d\nAs for his own future, he admits that some time or other, he will have to leave UWC behind. It will be sad, but such is the reality of life and sport. Williams is 48 years old and, like anyone else, has ambitions.\n\u201cI would love to be a professional coach, to be able to coach at a higher level,\u201d he laments. \u201cFor me, UWC provides the perfect platform to get to the next level. I am very happy at UWC and I feel that I don\u2019t want to leave here \u2013 but I know the day will come when I will have to. When that does happen, I know UWC will have been the stepping stone.\u201d\nSo, as UWC prepare for their Varsity Cup debut, as the seminal moment draws near, as the call of history increases from a chime to a cacophony, Williams wants to send a personal word to each and every UWC student.\n\u201cMy message to UWC students as we get ready to play in the Varsity Cup is that we need their support. The players have worked very hard \u2013 not just with rugby training but in their studies too \u2013 and they are now going to put their bodies on the line for this university.\n\u201cI want to urge UWC students to come out and support and encourage the team; I want them to come to every single home game and show their love and support for the team, and to show UWC\u2019s way of playing sport.\u201d\nThis article was first published in the February 2019 Varsity Cup special edition of the Blue and Gold - UWC Sports\u2019 official magazine.

Still, despite the pandemic, we managed to have a fabulous Halloween. This year, 14yo decided she was too old for costumes and trick-or-treating, but I wanted to make sure the younger two still had some kind of trick-or-treat experience. I have the skills to be crafty, but not the time, so we ordered some Amazon costumes. A few days before Halloween, instead of walking our neighborhood, we drove to the homes of a handful of family members who had bags of candy ready for us.\nOne blessing this year was that Halloween fell on a Saturday, making it an all-day event. We started the day by filling bags with candy to give out to any children who still planned to trick-or-treat in our neighborhood. The kids set up an assembly line and quickly filled about 50 bags. With the pandemic, we had no idea how many bags to fill. In past years, we would have packed at least 100, but I figured 50 would be plenty.

He was in the midst of an epoch-making moment as a member of the Springboks\u2019 1995 World Cup-winning squad that inspired a nation. Now, as the head coach of UWC\u2019s rugby side, Williams can hear the call again: history beckons.\nLife and circumstance, somehow or other, often place certain individuals at the forefront of an era\u2019s critical moments. After his heroics as a player in 1995, when he was the face of a changing country, fate has now conspired to thrust Williams-the-coach into yet another significant, defining moment.\nUWC, drenched in a history so pivotal to the struggle against oppression and discrimination, makes its debut in the top-level Varsity Cup rugby tournament this year.\nIt is a momentous occasion for the University and its students, for Williams and his coaching staff and, above all, for the storied past so integral to UWC as an institution.\nThere has always been a strong rugby culture at UWC, despite it trailing behind traditional strongholds like Stellenbosch University, the University of Cape Town (UCT) and the University of Pretoria with regard to facilities and a historical pipeline of attracting the best rugby talent.\nNow, after dominating the lower-tier Varsity Shield and sealing promotion to the Varsity Cup with consummate ease, UWC has an opportunity for exposure - to reveal its potential as a sought-after academic university and, significantly, to add \u201crugby destination\u201d to its prospectus.\nThe Springboks\u2019 1995 triumph, in which Williams was so influential, was captured on screen in the movie Invictus. The title refers to a poem by William Ernest Henley, which speaks, in a particularly moving manner, about courage and dignity in the face of adversity, and of the indomitable spirit residing deep within us all. In the movie, former South African president Nelson Mandela, played by Morgan Freeman, recites a few lines from the poem: \u201cI am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul.\u201d\nIn the same way, as Williams and his Springbok teammates grabbed their destiny by laying their bodies on the line for an entire country in 1995, accepting that the moment was bigger than themselves, so too will Williams and his UWC squad be ready to accept this moment as the culmination of so much that has gone before. They stand at the precipice of history, fully aware that this, too, is bigger than just rugby.\nWilliams, now armed with the emotional experience of 1995, certainly understands the moment. \u201cIn 1995, we were doing it not just for SA but for the entire world,\u201d says Williams. \u201cEveryone wanted us to change, to see us become integrated as a nation. Still, now, I do guest-speaking about the 1995 World Cup success, and I am still stopped at malls and other public places where people speak to me about it and ask for photos. It was an amazing time for us as a nation.\n\u201cThis time, with UWC, it\u2019s different but also the same in that we are the only previously disadvantaged university in the Varsity Cup. For UWC, this moment is as big as in 1995. It creates an opportunity for this university to get much-needed exposure and, at the same time, to showcase its rugby talent.\u201d\nAs Williams has played at the highest level of the sport, he is fully aware of the challenges his team will face. He is not na\u00efve; he knows it will be difficult. However, he has called on his players to be the masters of their own fate \u2013 their future doesn\u2019t have to be determined by others; they are in a position to shape their own destiny.\nWilliam\u2019s aura and charisma have animated this particular squad and, as preparations continue for the University\u2019s big moment, he will continue to be the captain of their souls \u2013 a guiding, galvanising and inspirational presence.\n\u201cWhen I took the job (in 2016), I wanted to do something different,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to go back to the culture and tradition of UWC. I wanted to do what was best for the team. And I wanted to return to the history and to enhance the culture.\n\u201cSo when I arrived, the first thing was to instil discipline \u2013 players were coming to training when they wanted to and I needed to change that. I had to get the players to trust and respect each other.

We are changing the environment to be more suitable for ourselves, while these changes are having a negative impact on many species on many different levels, including the probability of developing cancer.\u201d\nHow can this happen?\nSepp said: \u201cIt is already known in human studies that obesity and nutrient deficiency can cause cancer, but these issues have been mostly overlooked in wild animals.
