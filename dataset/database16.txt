The objectives of the 2015 Innovation Fund (IF) are to enable institutions and their best researchers to:\n\u2022 Strive for global leadership by conducting world-class transformative research and technology development in areas of institutional strategic priority;\n\u2022 Forge and foster productive, value-added partnerships within and among institutions, sectors and disciplines that will nurture creativity and innovation resulting in an effective and sustainable use of the research infrastructure and facilities;\n\u2022 Identify and develop plans and potential pathways to social, health, environmental and economic benefits for Canada, including better training and improved skills for highly qualified personnel.\nThe Office of Research Services in collaboration with the Faculty Deans would like to invite all faculty members and research centres to submit CFI IF Expressions of Interest with infrastructure project proposals that would be competitive under the IF. At this time, the proposals will not be evaluated but will be used to seek opportunities for collaboration among researchers, other academic institutions and partners. Once the CFI issues a formal call for proposals (Notice of Intent (NOI) to apply), the VP (REDI) then will formally issue an internal call for NOIs.\nThe CFI\u2019s Challenge to Institutions\nIt is important to note that for this competition (to access the CFI call, click here), the CFI will be challenging institutions to propose transformative infrastructure projects that will underpin cutting-edge research and will have a structural effect on Canada\u2019s research landscape. As well, the CFI expects that projects funded through the 2015 IF competition will support promising and innovative directions in research or technology development in areas where Canada currently is, or has the potential to be, competitive on the global stage. The CFI has indicated that it will support initiatives that allow institutions and their researchers to build on and enhance an emerging strategic priority area, accelerate current research and technology development work or take established capabilities to a globally competitive level.\nUnder the 2015 IF competition, the CFI is encouraging institutions to submit proposals for which there is a proven record of, or a strong potential for, excellence and commitment. Institutions are also being encouraged to consider how their proposals can be made more competitive through collaboration with appropriate partners and to plan co-operatively to acquire, develop and maintain infrastructure. Finally, in developing proposals, institutions are encouraged to engage with end-users of research or technology development to clearly define the potential benefits for Canadians.\nFor purposes of the 2015 IF competition, the CFI has placed a limit on the total value of funding that an eligible institution can request from this fund.

But Lynn Povich lived that era, working behind-the-scenes as a researcher for Newsweek magazine with little rights and no chance to move up the ranks.\nPovich\u2014the daughter of legendary sports reporter Shirley Povich and sister of talk show host Maury\u2014is one of the freedom fighters of that time who, along with a team of 45 other women, created the first female class action suit against Newsweek magazine. In the suit the pushed-aside women demanded equality in the workplace, a movement that spread across the journalism industry until, in 1975, almost 1/3 of reporters in the media were women.\nHer monumental story remained relatively untold throughout the years, until Povich took matters into her own hands (once again) and wrote her own non-fiction account. The Good Girls Revolt, released in 2012, tells the story of how Povich\u2019s team of women changed the workplace for all.\nWe spoke with Povich prior to her appearance at the Katz JCC on Nov. 11, where she\u2019ll be discussing her book along with its storied history.\nSOUTH JERSEY MAGAZINE: What were your goals when writing The Good Girls Revolt?\nLYNN POVICH: Our story was really lost to history. Newsweek didn\u2019t have a shred of evidence about the lawsuit. Women that were working there in 2010 were shocked to find out that they were working at the spot of a landmark lawsuit. But there was also not a lot of publicity about it in general. Not a lot of people knew that we were the first, and I didn\u2019t want my legacy to be lost. I wanted the next generation of women coming up in this career to know who laid the groundwork down for them.\nSJM: What kind of reaction do you get from young women in your field?\nLP: They\u2019re amazed at the truth of the lawsuit. They can\u2019t believe that women were told they couldn\u2019t write. They are often amazed that they organized under a women\u2019s lawsuit right under the nose of their bosses, and how we were very successful. Three months after we filed, the women at Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated magazines filed their own suits. It had an immediate impact on the journalistic community, and the young women today didn\u2019t know it. When I get to speak to young journalists they actually reach out and say \u2018thank you.\u2019\nSJM: How do you think your message impacts younger girls, who haven\u2019t had to experience gender inequality at the same level?\nLP: Most people in college or university haven\u2019t experienced that much discrimination, because they are doing so well in school\u2014more women are graduating with degrees than ever. Schools treat students fairly equally, so you don\u2019t feel discrimination, so for me to talk to them about what they may face in the workplace is important. But I also talk about confidence. These young women are very smart, and it just astounds me that they aren\u2019t more confident in their abilities. And part of it is because women are supposed to be nice, but I\u2019m surprised that more women aren\u2019t more confident in the workforce.\nSJM: How have you seen the treatment of women change in your field since your fight in 1970?\nLP: It\u2019s hard to generalize, because there\u2019s been enormous progress.

I formulated this tea blend with a small ration of these potent plants but as with all herbs in the medicinal category, it is sensible to consume on a schedule not exceeding 10 days consecutively.\nChamomile (Matricaria recutita) and peppermint (Mentha piperita) make up the bulk of this blend. These gentle, food-type herbs relax the body, specifically the digestive system. When tension is released from this area more efficient digestion occurs. Did you know bile is released from the gall bladder only when it is relaxed? Digestion stops during the first half of sleep but resumes during REM sleep. The less your mind has to give attention to during this time the better it can focus on restoring brain tissues. This makes sense as far as restful sleep is concerned. The fewer side quests your brain goes on during the night, the more refreshed you feel in the morning.\nBee balm (Monarda didyma) is like the cherry on top, supporting the mood and digestion even further. I appreciate bee balm's antimicrobial nature in a before-bed drink. It's like a gentle mouth wash for your whole digestive tract. The taste is unexpected and definitely upgrades the flavor of the tea as a whole. Pregnant individuals should use caution around bee balm as it can stimulate contractions of the uterus in some people.\nNeurons communicating steady and accurate, thoughts slowed down, tension released...

Today, the company provides services to more than 275,000 coin-operated washers and dryers in three states, using a fleet of about 350 vans and more than 500 employees to get the job done. Until recently, they were relying on three separate systems to manage vehicle tracking, fuel and fleet maintenance/management. According to COO Chris Hannum, it was not easy to keep the separate systems aligned or to create the reports needed to help the company reduce costs and improve efficiencies.\nThey were also looking for a better way to control fuel costs, he notes, and to gain more visibility into what was actually happening out on the road. \u201cWe used to give drivers a fuel card for a particular fuel supplier,\u201d Hannum says, \u201cbut that was not always the best choice. Some drivers were going out of route to get to one of those stations and we had no way to tell if someone was using premium fuel instead of medium-grade fuel or spending over the set limit.\u201d\nWash Multifamily Laundry Systems chose to work with GE Capital Fleet Services in October of 2010. \u201cWe initially looked at GE's leasing services, but quickly saw the value of the Monitor and Intelligent Ops integrated with the telematics solution,\u201d recalls Hannum. \u201cThe GE solution gives us exactly what we wanted: tracking, fuel-purchase management and fleet maintenance/management all in one integrated system.

One of the reasons we started The Julia Training Institute is we believed that learning must become more interactive, interesting and intellectually challenging. If their homework is like most of what I had in high school, it really doesn\u2019t matter much whether they remember the names of the seven Chinese poets whose work they had to read for some completely unfathomable reason.\nThe truth is, much of work is like this as well. When I get up in the morning, I usually listen to my voice mail and read my email at the same time, while drinking a cup of coffee. I delete all of the messages offering to sell me Viagara that somehow slipped through my spam filter, take two seconds to respond to the student who asked if I would be willing to serve as a reference (It would be my pleasure.) I also delete the voice mail messages from the carpet cleaner (I don\u2019t need the carpets cleaned), write on my calendar the reminder from the dentist\u2019s office that my appointment is on Thursday, and add it to Yahoo calendar so I will be sent an email and text message that morning.\nWhen I need to focus, I would bet that I do the same as those teenagers when they really do have a challenging assignment. That is, I turn off everything else and focus on the matter at hand.\nIn my work life, I switch focus, a lot. I will work on a program to calculate statistics to test effectiveness of our training for parents of children in special education. Then I\u2019ll switch to writing web pages for our next course to come on line, Developmental Psychology. After an hour, I might go on to working on a grant proposal, before going back to writing up the report on the statistical output from the program I wrote earlier. If need be, I can put everything aside and focus on one thing for sixteen hours a day, and sometimes that is warranted, but that is not usually how I work.\nI am going to take the dissenting view on this one. I think technology has increased my productivity. I cannot imagine getting the amount of work done that I do if I did not have two things going at once for most of my waking hours.

According to the author, who cites actual science as evidence, we are all becoming progressively dumber due to doing two or three things at once. While talking on the cell phone, we become worse drivers and supposedly 2,600 deaths and 330,000 injuries occur due to cell phone use while driving each year. I am not sure how they arrive at these figures since I rather doubt that the highway patrol finds dead people with cell phones through their brains at the scene of accidents. When we get our statistics course on line next year I intend to talk A LOT about questionable assumptions and sample sizes.\nLet\u2019s look at the issue of whether multi-tasking really does make us less efficient at processing information, and, if so, whether that matters. How can it possibly not matter? Well, if we look at one of the findings that concerned Mr. Kirn so much, college students who sorted cards and listened to random tones at the same time did just as well at the sorting task but had more trouble remembering later on just what it was they were sorting. Who cares? I mean this very seriously. If you were sorting cards for some meaningless task for an experiment, would it matter at all to you the next day or even fifteen seconds later whether you were sorting by color, shapes, Zodiac signs or fruit vs. vegetable? Unless there was some kind of remembering-the-sort-category monetary prize, the answer is clearly,\n\u201cNo, it would not matter at all that you did not store a certain piece of useless information in your long-term memory.\u201d\nI would argue that much of what we are doing while multi-tasking involves the same sort of useless information. For example, the same article decries the fact that some number of adolescents do their homework while watching TV or listening to music on their iPods. This really is not a new phenomena. My aunts tell me that my grandmother was always yelling at them that they could not do their homework while listening to a radio program.\nTruly, if you don\u2019t remember what was on Sex and the City last week, it will not damage yo", "d scores it: Swanson, 10-9.\n3rdRound: Siver catches him with a left hook.

I think it\u2019s particularly hard in journalism because of the unpredictability of news and the schedule. If you want a family that is where it gets tricky\u2014women don\u2019t see how they can be good parents and bosses at the same time. I think that a lot of news organizations are run as old boys clubs and in a very macho culture.\nSJM: Your class action suit was a huge step in a time when women weren\u2019t known for speaking up about work discrimination. What was that time in your life like?\nLP: It was very agonizing. Once you file a lawsuit you are protected form being fired, but here we were organizing in the office, and we figured that if they knew they would fire us right away. We were really nervous about keeping it confidential; that we do this in a very organized, strategic way. And we succeeded because we managed to time our lawsuit at the same time as Newsweek was publishing an article called \u201cWomen in Revolt.\u201d But a lot of the men who were the writers and reporters who we worked with every day were very supportive. They knew we were smart and they knew what we were capable of.\nSJM: Does the TV show Mad Men get that generation right?\nLP: I\u2019ve been watching Mad Men and I really like it. I think they do a really good job representing the advertising industry. I feel lucky that the book came out after Mad Men, because it brought back\u2014in a very entertaining way\u2014that time. The women that I talk to that like Mad Men don\u2019t just watch it for the clothes; they watch it so they can see what it\u2019s like in that workplace. They identify with the women in that workplace, and I think it set the ground for having my book, a real life workplace story, come out after that.\nSJM: How much did your father inspire your path to journalism?\nLP: My father was such a wonderful writer that I actually avoided it! I felt that I couldn\u2019t live up to his writing, and I got into journalism accidentally. If I had gotten a job any other place who knows where I would have ended up; I think it was fated to be. My strengths were more as an editor than as a writer, and he was a better writer. But he had a great appreciation for good writing: He would often bring home great columns that he felt were well-written and read them at the dinner table. In my life, he was very much somebody who fought for the underrepresented, especially in sports. The Washington Redskins was the last team to integrate in the [National Football League], and he pounded the owner of the team to integrate in his columns all the time. That was very influential when it came to my own fight.\nSJM: What was it like growing up in the Povich household?\nLP: It was all about sports. I grew up with two older brothers, so it was very much about sports, so they could a lot that I couldn\u2019t do. They were bat boys for the teams, but my dad was very good about supporting me as well.

Some businesses used social media to connect with customers quarantined at home; others joined a boycott of Facebook to protest the way the company handles hate speech. And with a presidential election approaching, campaigns reached voters through the Hype Machine amid concerns about how foreign actors use the networks to sway election results. Social media holds potential for both promise and peril and we\u2019re at the crossroads.\nIn his new book \u201cThe Hype Machine: How Social Media Disrupts Our Elections, Our Economy, and Our Health \u2014 And How We Must Adapt,\u201d excerpted below, Aral, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, lays out the path to achieve the promise of social media. This includes understanding the forces at play and the science behind the Hype Machine, and what social media companies, policymakers, and users need to do to achieve the promise and avoid the peril of this new social order.\nEvery minute of every day, our planet now pulses with trillions of digital social signals, bombarding us with streams of status updates, news stories, tweets, pokes, posts, referrals, advertisements, notifications, shares, check-ins, and ratings from peers in our social networks, news media, advertisers, and the crowd. These signals are delivered to our always-on mobile devices through platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter, and they are routed through the human social network by algorithms designed to optimize our connections, accelerate our interactions, and maximize our engagement with tailored streams of content. But at the same time, these signals are much more transformative \u2014 they are hypersocializing our society, scaling mass persuasion, and creating a tyranny of trends. They do this by injecting the influence of our peers into our daily decisions, curating population-scale behavior change, and enforcing an attention economy. I call this trifecta of hypersocialization, personalized mass persuasion, and the tyranny of trends the New Social Age.\nIn 2013, a false tweet briefly wiped out almost $140 billion in U.S. stock market value.\nThe striking thing about the New Social Age is that fifteen years ago this cacophony of digital social signals didn\u2019t even exist. Fifteen short years ago, all we had to facilitate our digital connections was the phone, the fax machine, and email. Today, as more and more new social technologies come online, we know less and less about how they are changing us. Why does fake news spread so much faster than the truth online? How did one false tweet wipe out $140 billion in stock market value in minutes? How did Facebook change the 2012 presidential election by tweaking one algorithm? Did Russian social media manipulation flip the 2016 U.S. presidential election? When joggers in Venice, Italy, post their runs to social media, do joggers in Venice, California, run faster? These questions contemplate the disruptive power of social media. By answering them, we can better understand how the Hype Machine impacts our world.\nThe Hype Machine has created a radical interdependence among us, shaping our thoughts, opinions, and behaviors. This interdependence is enabled by digital networks, like Facebook and Twitter, and guided by machine intelligence, like newsfeed and friend-suggestion algorithms. Together they are remaking the evolution of the human social network and the flow of information through it. These digital networks expose the controls of the Hype Machine to nation-states, businesses, and individuals eager to steer the global conversation toward their ends, to mold public opinion, and ultimately to change what we do. The design of this machine, and how we use it, are reshaping our organizations and our lives. And the Hype Machine is even more relevant today than it was before the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the world onto social media en masse.\nBy now we\u2019ve all heard the cacophony of naysayers declaring that the sky is falling as new social technologies disrupt our democracies, our economies, and our public health.

You open your eyes and think that there is nothing better than waking up to the sight of Redang Island\u2018s blue, gleaming waters and the gentle strokes of a cool ocean breeze.\nNot all resorts offer this experience, though. In fact, it is common for resort buildings to build inward (vertically towards the mainland) instead of parallel to the sea to optimize land usage. So, which resorts should you pick for the best sea view rooms at Redang Island?\n1. The Taaras Redang Resort\nThe Taaras Resort houses 190 stylish suites and rooms, with some options for rooms perched on cliffs overlooking the ocean and resort below.\nWe recommend the Ocean Front and Cliff Premier rooms that offer spectacular views over the resort to the white sands and crystal clear waters of Redang Island, and beyond. The interiors are tastefully designed with island-inspired furniture and fabrics to give you a truly luxurious stay. Relax and enjoy the view from the freestanding spa bathtub, or from a private balcony that\u2019s both spacious and clean. This makes for a truly memorable Redang Island sea view room experience.\nFor the ultimate vacation experience, take a look at The Taaras Villa. Resembling a house more than a \u2018room\u2019, this private clifftop, the five-bedroom villa overlooks the resort with sweeping views out to the South China Sea. The Taaras Villa comes with a private infinity pool, breakfast chef and butler, and security service. Have you just found the perfect luxurious private getaway? Quite possibly so!\n2. Laguna Redang Resort\nLocated along the beach overlooking the South China Sea, Laguna Redang Island Resort offers comfortable accommodation with free Wi-Fi in public areas. Its location is super convenient as it is near to other attractions on the island.\nThe resort\u2019s sea view rooms are the Deluxe Sea, Premier Sea and Laguna Suite. These rooms feature breathtaking views of the white sandy beach and deep blue sea. The Laguna Suite is the largest of the three, with an equally large balcony that overlooks the stunning ocean. This makes it one of the best Redang sea view rooms in our book!\nAs a bonus, the restaurant here also features some really great views of the sea. Area \u2018A\u2019 at the restaurant is the coveted spot where the dining area is built outward, promising a good view of the sea. However, keep in mind that during hotter days, this area will heat up slightly as there are no blinds to block the sunlight.\n3. Redang Holiday Beach Villa\nRedang Holiday Beach Villa is the ideal spot to unwind, soul-search and relax. Spectacularly built on the edge of a stunning lagoon, the resort is quite possibly Redang Island\u2019s most picturesque and charming establishment. Its traditional rustic Malay style architecture, built of quality local hardwood, blends in perfectly with the lush, green landscape of the island.\nThe air-conditioned rooms each have their own private balcony and en suite bathroom. But where you want to head to is the Semi-D Bungalow Sea", "we are targeting the city ultimately or ideally to be 50% Hong Kong people and 50% local people together with people from around the world\u201d.\nKo and other backers of the project have emphasised the need for the Irish government and local authorities to work closely with private investors in order for the project to be a success for all parties.

Perhaps our Rest Easy herbal tea blend, with its neurotransmitter managing and whole body relaxing plant components, can be of assistance?\nWild lettuce (Lactuca virosa) contains lactucin and lactucopircin which have sedative and analgesic (pain relieving) effects on the central nervous system. It's capable of more than just helping your muscles relax though. Wild lettuce has an interesting inhibitory effect on cholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for slowing down the electrical signals between brain cells. Intriguingly, an excess of this enzyme results in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s. The lactucopircin literally enhances the connections between brain cells making them stronger. I think it\u2019s incredible that this plant that makes you sleepy ALSO has an effect on the strength of the connections between brain cells. Sleep is when your brain does it\u2019s repair work! \ud83e\udd2f This plant is in the medicinal category and should be consumed under the guidance of your preferred medical professional. I formulated this tea blend with a small ration of these potent plants but as with all herbs in the medicinal category, it is sensible to consume on a schedule not exceeding 10 days consecutively.\nSkullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora) and passionflower (Passiflora incarnata) are pretty powerful in the anxiety and restlessness department. They both have stimulating effects on the neurotransmitter GABA via the gut brain, which is responsible for calming excessively excited neurons. Neurons that are firing too easily and therefore too often. Racing thoughts halted. I think it's super neat how these plants can work in tandem to create a well-rounded approach to brain wellness. These herbs are in the medicinal category and should be consumed under the guidance of your preferred medical professional, e", "Location: Stourbridge, West Midlands, UK\nThe Midlands Whisky Festival is currently run bi-annually in Stourbridge and Birmingham.

Scandal after scandal has rocked social media giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram in what seems like a backlash from which they can never recover.\nBut when the social media revolution began, the world\u2019s social platforms had an idealistic vision of connecting our world. They planned to give everyone free access to the information, knowledge, and resources they needed to experience intellectual freedom, social and economic opportunity, better health, job mobility, and meaningful social connections. They were going to fight oppression, loneliness, inequality, poverty, and disease. Today, they\u2019ve seemingly exacerbated the very ills they set out to alleviate.\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned, from twenty years researching and working with social media, is that these technologies hold the potential for exceptional promise and tremendous peril \u2014 and neither the promise nor the peril is guaranteed. Social media could deliver an incredible wave of productivity, innovation, social welfare, democratization, equality, health, positivity, unity, and progress. At the same time, it can and, if left unchecked, will deliver death blows to our democracies, our economies, and our public health. Today we are at a crossroads of these realities.\nThe argument of \u201cThe Hype Machine: How Social Media Disrupts Our Elections, Our Economy, and Our Health\u201d is that we can achieve the promise of social media while avoiding the peril. To do so, we must step out of our tendency to armchair-theorize about how social media affects us and develop a rigorous scientific understanding of how it works. By looking under the hood at how the Hype Machine operates and employing science to decipher its impact, we can collectively steer this ship away from the impending rocks and into calmer waters.\nUnfortunately, our understanding and our progress have been impeded by the hype surrounding the Hype Machine. We\u2019ve been overwhelmed by a tidal wave of books, documentaries, and studies of one-off events designed for media attention but lacking rigor and generalizability. The hype is not helpful because it clouds our vision of what we actually know (and don\u2019t know) from the scientific evidence on how social media affects us.\nWhile our discourse has been shrouded in sensational hysteria, the three primary stakeholders at the center of the controversy\u2014the platforms, the politicians, and the people\u2014have all been pointing their fingers at each other. Social media platforms blame our ills on a lack of regulation. Governments blame the platforms for turning a blind eye to the weaponization of their technology. And the people blame their governments and the platforms for inaction. But the truth is, we\u2019ve all been asleep at the switch. In the end, each of us must take responsibility for the part we are playing in the Hype Machine\u2019s current direction.\nNot only are we all partly to blame, but we are all partly responsible for what happens next. As Mark Zuckerberg himself has noted, governments will need to adopt sensible, well-informed regulations. The platforms will need to change their policies and their design. And for the sake of ourselves and our children, we will all need to be more responsible in how we use social media in our digital town square. There is no silver bullet for the mess we find ourselves in, but there are solutions.\nAchieving the promise of the New Social Age, while avoiding its peril, will require all of us\u2014social media executives, lawmakers, and ordinary citizens\u2014to think carefully about how we approach our new social order. As a society, we will need to utilize the four levers available to us: the money (or financial incentives) created by their business models, the code that governs social platforms, the norms we develop in using these systems, and the laws we write to regulate their market failures. Along the way, we will need to design scientific solutions that balance privacy, free speech, misinformation, innovation, and democracy. This is, no doubt, a monumental responsibility. But considering the overwhelming influence the Hype Machine has on our lives, it is a responsibly we cannot abdicate.\nExcerpted from the book THE HYPE MACHINE: How Social Media Disrupts Our Elections, Our Economy, and Our Health\u2014and How We Must Adapt by Sinan Aral.
