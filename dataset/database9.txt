Several options are always welcome.\nWhat is Arkadiko?\nArkadiko is a small bridge between Spring and OSGi.\nHow does Arkadiko relate to the methodologies listed above?\nAside from the Services First principle (which is purely beneficial in any case), the methodologies listed above each have their own benefits and drawbacks.\nPojoSR does not give you access to true OSGi environment but can be a significant boon particularly during testing. I can certainly help with the unraveling of a complex application, but I argue that in spending time learning to use the library one could have spent the time with Arkadiko and gotten a few steps further in actually starting to leverage OSGi more directly.\nIn the case of the Super Bundle, there is no consideration for applications which do not manage their execution environment, such as web applications. Also, in many sufficiently complex scenarios it may be impossible to completely encasulate an existing application entirely within an OSGi bundle without being significantly constrained or without lose of functionality.\nHow can Arkadiko help?\nArkadiko is an attempt to provide a new migration option, and borrows ideas from many of the above methodologies and tries to marry into those the concepts of Quick Win and Time to Evolve.\nQuick Win: Often the light at the end of the tunnel seems awfully far away. When reviewing the scope of a complex migration, it may seem like an eternity before the benefits will pay off. Arkadiko gives you OSGi right now! How does it do that? It simply provides a means to wire an OSGi framework into your current spring container. But that in itself doesn't help and so it can also dynamically register all your beans as services and at the same time registers OSGi ServiceTrackers for beans matching specific exclusion/inclusion rules. It does this so that if matching services are published into the OSGi framework they can be automatically wired in place of those original beans. You get OSGi right away! It also means that the OSGi framework has access to all your beans and can use those as regular services.\nTime to Evolve: You have time to evolve your platform into OSGi as you see fit, as time allows, moving components slowly from outside the OSGi framework into the framework as re-design is completed by component, while still gaining immediate access to it's features for others. Also, those nasty libraries which have yet to be ported or are still known to not live happily inside of OSGi framework can remain outside the framework, consumed and wired from within the container, until such a time as they evolve their own OSGi solutions.\nArkadiko is very small and very simple! It only comprises a few classes.\nAdding Arkadiko to your existing spring configurations is as simple as adding a few beans.

Talk about your sweet deals.\nNot only that but she\u2019s risen to the ranks of official court reporting, the Ford Administration\u2019s go-to print mouthpiece. Sue-Ann Levy, the voice of the mayor of Toronto. Who could\u2019ve seen the stars align in such a way for that to happen?\nStill, partisan hackery isn\u2019t all bons bons and caviar. Sometimes there\u2019s real work to be done. All the moving parts of this Rube Goldberg contraption that is the Rob Ford mayoralty have to work just so for it to function properly, and god knows there\u2019s been some seizing up of the machine for a while now. It takes some resolve to continue tinkering in order to keep the wheels from coming off completely.

As such it aims to drive developers toward declarative, component driven design and lose coupling. But, it is largely a static container. The class space is flat and once started there is little means for dynamic change.\nOSGi is \"the\" modularity framework for java. It supports dynamic change via strict classloader isolation and packaging metadata. It also aims to drive developers toward modular design. But although it is very powerfull it is also complex and learning it's intricacies can be daunting.\nThese two paradigms have recently undergone a merge or sorts in such that within OSGi frameworks one can use the declarative nature of Spring (via Spring DM and more recently standardised as Blueprint) to configure and wire together components as they come and go from the OSGi framework.\nGiven the sheer number of Spring based projects and the most recent up-surge in the desire to benefit from OSGi's dynamic modularity it has become clear that there can be significant difficulties in moving projects of any complexity to OSGi. The issue is the learning curve surrounding design changes that must be made in moving traditional java applications, including Spring based ones. OSGi has a puritanical solution to a vast number of problems caused by the traditional architectures, but in order to gain from those solutions a considerable amount of redesign has to be done.\nWhat to do?\nThere are several well known projects and individuals promoting methodologies and best practices to help undertake the considerable amount of work that such migrations potentially involve.\nServices First: A well known presentation by BJ Hargrave (IBM) and Peter Kriens (aQute) (http://www.slideshare.net/bjhargrave/servicesfirst-migration-to-osgi) defines the concept of services first migration methodology. This methodology suggests that the first steps in the migration is to re-design the existing architecture such that it is based on a services oriented design. They offer some insight into how that is accomplished paraphrased over several different articles about \u03bcservices (micro-services). Once this has been accomplished it becomes far simpler to isolate portions of code that form logical components into modules which use or publish services in well defined manner to subsequently be turned into OSGi bundles.\nPojoSR: A core developer of the Apache Felix project, Karl Pauls, maintains a library called PojoSR (http://code.google.com/p/pojosr/) based on some of the Apache Felix project code that itself does not implement a full OSGi framework container, but essentially provides an active registry which scans the class space for recognizable services and effectively tries to provide a central access point for those.\nSuper Bundle: Another often recommended methodologies is that of the Super Bundle. This approach suggests taking a complete application and initially packaging it within a single monolithic bundle with the intention that pieces then be separated out into smalle", "What notable feature allows the ibot wheelchair to climb stairs and raises the user to standing height", "future ski season.

After graduating from the City College of New York and Harvard Law, he worked as an assistant to Henry Stimson in the office of the District Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In 1914, Frankfurter became a member of the Harvard Law faculty. During the World War, he held a number of positions in government, returning to Harvard in 1919. One of the founders of the American Civil Liberties Union, Frankfurter was known as a staunch supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the election of 1932 and was one of FDR`s leading advisers. Roosevelt appointed Frankfurter to the Supreme Court in 1939. Expected to be a liberal judge, Frankfurter soon gained a reputation as a conservative, more due to his strongly held belief about the appropriate limits of Judicial Review than personal conservatism. This position was clearly evident when Frankfurter wrote the majority opinion in Gobitis in 1940. The need of the state to promote patriotism overbalanced", "the individual liberty of noncompliance. When the Supreme Court reversed itself in 1943, Frankfurter wrote a dissent, in which he separated his personal inclinations from what he regarded as his duty to the law:\nOne who belongs to the most vilified and persecuted minority in history is not likely to be insensible to the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution. Were my purely personal attitude relevant, I should wholeheartedly associate myself with the general libertarian views in the Court`s opinion, representing, as they do, the thought and action of a lifetime. But, as judges, we are neither Jew nor Gentile, neither Catholic nor agnostic. We owe equal attachment to the Constitution, and are equally bound by our judicial obligations whether we derive our citizenship from the earliest or the latest immigrants to these shores.Frankfurter remained on the court until 1962.

Fiskars 12 Inch LED SureCut Folding Rotary Trimmer\nArticle Courtesy Scrapjazz.com: by Christine Ousley\nI have been using a Fiskars trimmer for some time now and have always loved them but when I saw the new Fiskars 12 Inch LED SureCut Folding Rotary Paper Trimmer, I thought that maybe it was time for a new one. I am so glad that I tried it out because it is my favorite of my Fiskars trimmers so far.\nOne of my favorite features of this trimmer is that it folds in half to create a 6\u201d platform. This is great if you want a full-size rotary trimmer but have limited space.\nAnother reason I love the folded platform is something that most card makers will appreciate. Most other trimmers have their joint somewhere between the 5 \u00bc\u201d and 5 \u00bd\u201d mark. This makes it very difficult to cut mats for the standard size card. With the Fiskars SureCut trimmer the 6\u201d platform allows for easy cutting of anything needed for cards.\nHere is a close-up of the cutting blade.

Placing your hand and fingers on the paper stabilizer while cutting allows very precise cutting.\nTips & Techniq", "you may never need to use a wheelchair in your entire life, but some people use one

Never question your meal ticket\u2019s actions. It\u2019s always the other guy\u2019s fault. Haughty ambitions or weak constitutions are to blame for any falling outs with the mayor. Never is he or his brother or the third Etobicoke amigo, Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday in the wrong. Suggesting as much could lead to some unwelcomed introspection or, even worse, unreturned phone calls from the mayor\u2019s office.\nAny hint of desperation in Sue-Ann\u2019s outbursts \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to detect since it sounds like her usual ravings \u2013 is because she\u2019s hitched her little red wagon so firmly to Mayor Ford\u2019s star. A star that\u2019s dimmed significantly over the course of the last year to 18 months. If Sue-Ann and the Toronto Sun can\u2019t keep the Team Ford super nova from flaming out entirely, they\u2019ll find themselves once more in the power shadow, no longer the mayor\u2019s official paper of record and just another rag with a Sunshine girl and sports scores.\nBeing so closely aligned with the current administration and lashing out at any apostate, regardless of political stripe, Sue-Ann Levy risks being relegated deep into the bleacher seats again. Having been granted access to power, she\u2019s showing her true colours and they\u2019re not conservative blue. It\u2019s a shade you turn when you give up reporting or even opining, and just start typing out p.r. memos from head office. What\u2019s that look like? A buttery yellow?\nSue-Ann Levy refers to herself as a \u2018general s\u2014 disturber\u2019. Actual shit disturbers don\u2019t say s\u2014 disturber. They say shit disturber. And real shit disturbers don\u2019t simply regurgitate talking points and pick fights as a proxy for those in power. That\u2019s called sy\u2014phancy.\nSuch lack of self-awareness would be sad if it weren\u2019t on display by the likes of Sue-Ann Levy.

It\u2019s difficult to get the ideas across. You have to basically just go out there and sit down with the guys in the factory and just you know, almost playing kind of a charades game, right?\nSort of putting things together until you\u2019re convinced that they actually understand the vision of the product. And then once they actually understand clearly what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, a lot of magic happens over there. And they actually do really good work. But one of the big fallacies of kind of going over there is you\u2019re sort of like, \u201cWell, I just sent them some Gerber Files and a sketch and I\u2019ll get something back. And it\u2019ll be great.\u201d And that\u2019s kind of true for really cookie-cutter products like if I just want a beige box with a circuit board in it and an RJ-45 jack and a power cord. Okay. You can do that. Right? Because they do this all the time. But if you want to do something really different, you really have to kind of be out there on the ground and working directly with the people.\nJT: I\u2019m curious how the \u2014 I know that the exchange rates have been changing quite a bit over the last few years. How is that affecting the practicality of doing business in China?\nAH: It\u2019s a good question. Well, our price quotes are done in U.S. dollars typically. So a lot of times exchange rates actually come out of the manufacturer\u2019s bottom-line depending upon if it\u2019s going in their favor or against their favor. At some point in time, you have to renegotiate things. But there\u2019s exchange rate, but there\u2019s also sort of the factor that the labor is tremendously cheaper in China. The differential is 20 to 40 X between the United States and China for comparable quality of labor. And the exchange rate would have to change a lot to sort of gobble up that difference.\nJT: That leads into my next question which is that many people feel uncomfortable buying products produced in China because they worry that they really don\u2019t know what type of conditions the workers experience in the factories. What\u2019s been your experience with this? And how do you feel about it?\nAH: So there\u2019s factories and there\u2019s factories in China. There\u2019s definitely bad factories that you don\u2019t want to work with. And there\u2019s ones that are good. And one of the reasons why I like to go out on the floor to China is I like to make sure that all the people that we work with are treated well and humanely, right? So I actually stay in the factory dorms and eat the factory food. So they can\u2019t \u2014 I mean there\u2019s things that guys can do still in China to sort of fool me. Like they have a special day when they know I\u2019m coming to the floor and they\u2019ll give them extra special food or something. That\u2019s happened before. But generally speaking, I like to make sure that the conditions are good. And I sleep well at night knowing that we build Chumby in factories where people are actually fairly well taken care of, right?\nThe standard of living is overall lower in China, so it\u2019s not like \u2014 it\u2019s a far cry from, you know, I was reading the other day Boeing union labor gets paid $110,000 a year for machining parts. And they live in Seattle living conditions. And wow, that\u2019s really great. I mean that\u2019s really phenomenal living conditions for manufacturing. But at the same time, if I was paying machinists $110,000 to build Chumby, the price of the device would be four or five X higher just from the labor cost alone, right? It\u2019d be impossible to build in the United States for the price that we get it at. So there\u2019s some tradeoffs to be made there in terms of the quality of living. But that being said, I\u2019d say the quality of living\u2019s pretty comparable to actually like a college dorm in the United States. That\u2019s about what I have to say for that out there.\nJT: So lots of Ramen?\nAH: Yeah. Yeah. I mean the food is actually pretty good in China. You get cheap food in China. It\u2019s the crowded living conditions and the fact it\u2019s a dorm living condition. The company gives you housing and medical care. And you don\u2019t get really much of a choice. So you pretty much live in a dorm. And you share it with four or five other people. And it\u2019s pretty crowded conditions. But these people are paid relatively well compared to what they have in the fields that they were working in before when they came from the countryside.\nJT: At what point is China going to stop being the production center for offshore companies and become the primary designer of goods in the same way that Japan went from being a manufacturing center to being a design center? And isn\u2019t it in China\u2019s best interest to remain basically focused on production?\nAH: That\u2019s a really interesting question. And there\u2019s kind of a couple of facets to it. And Japan\u2019s definitely taken some design leadership in terms of building eye-catching really interesting products. The thing is, China has a very productive design population as well, but they\u2019re a little different. If you look at \u2014 and this is eye-opening to me as well, right? As we at Chumby have tried to license our product out to more of the large brands that you\u2019ve heard of. I can\u2019t mention any of them specifically. But basically, it\u2019s kind of shocking. The way it works is a lot of these large brands have almost no engineers on the inside. You go buy a product on the shelf. And the U.S. office consists of some product managers and maybe a couple of product engineers. And what they do is they just write kind of a Word document that\u2019s 10 pages long.\nThey ship it off to China to a factory. And the factory actually does all of the work of taking that sort of sketch and that Word document and turning it into a real product, right? And they\u2019re really good at doing that. And they\u2019re very fast. And they\u2019re very efficient at it. So the thing that sort of the Chinese lack is sort of like market vision. If you ever see a product made by a local Chinese entrepreneur, they\u2019re often times these very nichey sort of almost quirky strange products. You get this kind of Chinglish thing going on where I could see where this could be useful, but it\u2019s just not the right product. So what really is lacking and the reason why China\u2019s sort of viewed as not innovative is they sort of lack the understanding of the American market. And I think they are a little heads down in terms of taking risks in terms of dramatic product design. Like they wouldn\u2019t do quite what some of the more dramatic I.D. companies will do and the really breath-taking good looking things. But they actually do \u2014 like a surprisingly large amount of design for very little money.\nJT: I have to ask one question just because I\u2019ve been to a fair number of CES\u2019s and there\u2019s always this China pavilion there. And I have to ask, do some of these companies know just how strange the names [of their companies] seem?\nAH: [Laughter] You know, I suppose the other way probably goes around as well when the Americans come over and they have really strange names as well. But yeah, they do have some really \u2014 Foo King Wah Semiconductor, whatever it is. They do have some really odd names.\nJT: I like the ones sort of like the Happy Semiconductor and something \u2013\nAH: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Happy and Lucky Semiconductor or Long Life Semiconductor or something like that.\nJT: I wouldn\u2019t mind a long life semiconductor, but I\u2019m not sure I need them to be happy and lucky.\nAH: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In Chinese, those names sound really good. They\u2019re direct translations of the Chinese name to English. It does highlight some of the cultural difference between the U.S. and China. I guess a lot of those guys could use a director of marketing or something like that to figure this out. They certainly don\u2019t have shelf presence, let\u2019s just say, the names.\nJT: So why don\u2019t you give us a little bit of a sneak peek of what you\u2019re going to be", "You may also download this file. Running time: 00:21:57\nChina has become the production workhorse of the consumer electronics industry. Almost anything you pick up at a Best Buy first breathed life across the Pacific Ocean. But what is it like to shepherd a product through the design and production process? Andrew \u201cbunnie\u201d Huang has done just that with the Chumby, a new internet appliance. He\u2019ll be speaking about the experience at the O\u2019Reilly Emerging Technology Conference. In an exclusive interview with Radar, he talks about the logistical and moral issues involved with manufacturing in China, as well as his take on the consumer\u2019s right to hack the hardware they purchase.\nJAMES TURNER: Andrew \u201cbunnie\u201d Huang is the Vice President of Hardware Engineering and Founder of Chumby Industries. He\u2019s pretty much the consummate hardware geek who has used his doctorate from MIT in electrical engineering to do everything from designing opto-electronics to hacking the Xbox. The Chumby, an internet appliance that delivers a cornucopia of information, is his latest endeavor. And he\u2019ll be talking about the process of getting it manufactured in China at O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Emerging Technology Conference in March. Thank you for taking the time to talk to us.\nANDREW HUANG: No problem.\nJT: So I have to start by asking, were you one of those kids who took everything apart in your house?\nAH: Oh, yeah. Yeah. My parents had a problem with that. There was lots of stuff taken apart. Not everything got back together again. Most things did. But there\u2019s definitely a few things that got hidden underneath the couch for a few days hoping my parents wouldn\u2019t notice, while I tried to find the last few screws and whatnot. They eventually figured out that the best way to try and contain me was to just give me other things to play with. So I got a computer and they got one of those 201 kits from Radio Shack for me to play with, so I would stop taking apart all of their alarm clocks and stuff.\nJT: You know, you can\u2019t get those kits at Radio Shack anymore. It\u2019s very disappointing.\nAH: I know. That is really sad. I mean those were really good kits. I mean I really learned a lot from the one that I had, and a couple other ones that were donated to me through friends or my friends\u2019 parents also were really engaging.\nJT: So you used to spend a lot of your time deconstructing the security infrastructure that manufacturers put in place. What in particular drives you in that direction?\nAH: The deconstruction of security infrastructure?\nAH: I mean a lot of it is just \u2014 it\u2019s more like if you just put a Rubik\u2019s Cube in front of me, I\u2019ll play with it. It\u2019s kind of the same thing. A lot of it comes from the fact that I\u2019ve actually been taking apart consumer electronic devices for decades now. And I always look at the construction and how it\u2019s built to learn something from it, because that\u2019s basically what I read to figure out the latest techniques for constructioning and costing and part selection.\nAnd when I start seeing someone mentioning security features that have some relevance to the hardware level, I start poking at it some more just because it\u2019s really interesting and you can learn something from it.\nJT: And have you ever run afoul of the DMCA or anything similar when you were poking around?\nAH: Yeah, the DMCA did create an unfortunate barrier to what was previously legal before it was passed. I had no problems doing this. And then all of the sudden, something that I\u2019d always done and thought was legal and thought was a healthy activity became illegal. And like for example, when I took apart the Xbox in, I think it was 2000, 2001 time domain, DMCA was just been out for like a couple or three years at that point in time. No one had really heard of it. And, of course, the Xbox is a fairly high profile platform. So eventually, I had some help from the EFF and from some very friendly professors at MIT, which was the school I was at the time. And we managed to sort of get me in compliance with DMCA, I guess you could say.\nJT: There seems to be a running battle between the users of equipment and the manufacturers, be it jail-broken iPhones or hacked Xboxes. How much control do you think a manufacturer legitimately should be allowed to have over the use of their hardware?\nAH: Well, I think that a manufacturer, basically once the hardware leaves the factory, and someone\u2019s paid whatever the market price is for it, then the user owns it, right? So I mean you could take that piece of hardware, melt it down and use it for the component metals if you want, use it for a doorstop. You could use it for something completely other than the computer, that you had not imagined it to be used for. So the hardware itself is pretty much \u2014 I kind of believe you buy it, you own it.\nAnd you have all the rights to it that you could possibly want with it, to be applied all the way to the Chumby as well. So we do have a security system in the Chumby, but you have the ability to completely wipe all security keys off of it if you want to. You don\u2019t have to use a Chumby with a Chumby network if you don\u2019t want to. You can go ahead and wipe all of our software off of it. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care.\nJT: Isn\u2019t there kind of a fuzzy area though, especially when you get into wireless devices, where some of the restrictions put in place on the devices are there for monetary reasons, but some of them are there for legitimate network control reasons?\nAH: Well, I mean a service is a service; a device is a device. Right? There\u2019s two different things we\u2019re talking about here. When you buy a device and you own it, you can do whatever you want with it. The fact that I\u2019ve bought a device doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m entitled to its service for free. So if you bought a cell phone and you\u2019re subscribing to a service, I mean there\u2019s some network access keys and whatnot. And I mean I can hack my device to get it off of your service. Right? So I\u2019m not tied to AT&T or something like that. But AT&T put up some towers and gives you a service. And you have to pay whatever they believe is the market value for that. Right? I don\u2019t have rights to that tower that\u2019s sitting two miles away from my house to use that without paying someone some fee for using that.\nJT: Those of us who have been around the internet enough can remember numerous failed attempts to commercialize internet appliances such as 3Com\u2019s Audrey. What do you think is going to make the Chumby different?\nAH: That\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m not an expert at the lore of the failed internet appliance devices. There\u2019s a couple things I think that\u2019s in our favor though is that \u2014 we\u2019re more open than a lot of the previous internet appliances, where I\u2019ve seen some of them where they try to create these walled gardens of content that you have to subscribe. You have to do this. You have to do that. We\u2019re sort of more user-centric and we have sort of an open development philosophy for sharing content.\nSo in other words, we don\u2019t tell you what to do with the internet appliance. It\u2019s exactly what you want it to be. You can hack it and do what you want with it which makes it more useful intrinsically to users. Right? Our business model is more focused on licensing our design out and getting it out there and letting other people who are good at hardware build hardware. And we\u2019ll focus on the service and making sure that your hardware\u2019s actually useful and can do something. So these are different things that other people didn\u2019t do before. And I think it is sort of a cognition that users know what\u2019s best for themselves, right? And also sort of understanding that there\u2019s the hardware piece and there\u2019s the service piece. And they have very different demands on the business. And we\u2019re trying to separate those two so that we have sort of a rational business model around that.\nJT: It\u2019s kind of interesting that the space that that device would sit in is being crowded a little bit because when I think about something I might plop dow", "What are the exciting changes that Joan's GF Great Bakes is implementing", "What are some of the innovative designs of wheelchairs discussed in the text", " \u2013 Many managers would rather not know, but not knowing can be detrimental to your customers\u2019 experience.\n- Why Employees Don\u2019t Pass Along Customer Complaints \u2013 If you rarely receive customer complaints from your front line employees, then read this article immediately!\n- Customer Service: Start With The End In Mind \u2013 Thoughts about whether customers or employees should be the primary focus of a new company.\n- How To Get More Customer Service Complaints! \u2013 Frequent customer complaints may not necessarily be a bad thing.\n- Is Your Customer Routing Strategy Like A Paper Map? \u2013 A fantastic metaphor and strategy for how contact center routing should operate.\n- 10 Companies With Excellent Customer Service \u2013 Can\u2019t say I agree with number 6, but what do you think?\n- Come In As Strangers, Leave As Friends \u2013 If you succeed in making your customers feel like friends, you could earn their loyalty for a long time.\n- Why New Customer Rewards Stink For The Rest Of Us \u2013 A lesson for businesses that loyal customers deserve rewards and appreciation just as much as new customers do.\n- Could You Compete Against a Customer Experience Giant? \u2013 Smaller retailers must be prepared to top the customer experience of their bigger and cheaper competitors.\n- Loyalty Is Earned, Not a Given \u2013 A strong case for why loyalty must be earned and how easily it can be lost by a business.\n- WOM Tip #215: Remarkable Thank-You Notes Amplify Customer Feedback \u2013 An incredibly creative and memorable way one customer service rep said thanks!\nSomeone Was Listening\nSometimes the most popular post from the previous month; sometimes just the one I liked best.\nThis month we were proud to debut When Customers Stick: Customer Retention by the Numbers (Infographic), our first CTS infographic!
