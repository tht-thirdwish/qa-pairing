Inmates can be imprisoned for up to four years.\nThe United Nations has called for the camps to be abolished a number of times and it appeared as if the Chinese government would close them in 2007, but they remained in force.\nCamp inmates interviewed by China Human Rights Defenders, another non-government organisation in Hong Kong, said they had been shackled upside down, electrocuted and forced to work when sick.\n''We worked between 14 and 15 hours every day, and aside from time for", "Magazine. pp. 68.\n- \"Spoilers: WWE Superstars Taping Results For 9/20\".

What matters is that you make a good painting, that you handle your subject freely. Otherwise, you might as well take a picture.\u201d\nThings have happened in my life that you think must have been sent\nToday his church interiors are well known, and his name is established as a painter, but when he started painting, the same name sometimes led to confusion. Articles in local newspapers would say that he not only painted, but also wrote books. They even met once, Maarten \u2018t Hart the novelist and Maarten \u2018t Hart the painter. \u201cLong ago. He got people who wanted to buy paintings and I got people who asked about books. I don\u2019t even remember who took the initiative, I believe he wrote me a letter. We\u2019re not family either, that\u2019s been sorted out once. Anyway: the name, the Reformed, and then also the garden. Because we are both still working on biology, he professionally and I as an amateur. I make an inventory of wild plants and regularly pass things on to nature organizations. So I\u2019ve been confused there too. And it still happens that you hear people say: look, that\u2019s where the writer lives and that is certainly his large garden. But we also have contradictions, of course. He has fallen from his faith.\u201d\nAnd you don\u2019t. Does faith play a role when you are painting?\n\u201cSometimes, yes. For example, when the light slides beautifully over a dinner table. I consciously capture such a moment in the painting that I make. And sometimes others take the symbols out. Once I was sent an article from a church magazine, in which a painting of mine was described. The painter meant this, the painter meant that, it said. I read it and I thought: that man is right. But I hadn\u2019t seen it that way myself. I mainly draw and paint logically: that the light has to come from that corner, and therefore through such and such windows, because that is then correct in the whole.\u201d\nDo you go to church on Sunday?\n\u201cYes, usually here in the village. I come from a Christian family and I kind of inherited that. I also like a bit of a strong sermon. And in church you maintain contact with fellow believers, which is also a way to nurture your faith. Apart from that, I have had a few experiences that have made the faith much stronger for me.\u201d\nCan you tell us more about that?\n\u201cI find that difficult. Let me say: things have happened in my life of which you think: that is absolutely impossible if you start to reason it normally, so that must have been directed.\u201d\nWould you like to try it anyway? Just writing this down makes it a bit\u2026\nHe hesitates. \u201cI hardly ever tell this story, it is mainly an experience that is very beautiful for ourselves.\u201d\nDan: \u201eI mainly paint a lot of churches, but I also paint old inner cities. One day I wanted to go to such an inner city, to sit there and draw. But the weather was nice, I actually felt more like working in the garden. Another time, I told myself. But in the garden I thought: I think I\u2019ll just start drawing. So I grabbed the bike, rode down the path for a bit, but then I thought again: no, I don\u2019t feel like it, I\u2019m going to work in the garden. It was a very strange doubt, I\u2019ve never had that before. So I put the bike back and went back into the garden. But I kept having that strange, uneasy feeling and thought again. I took the bike again and left. And what happens: I get on the train, where someone is waiting for me to show me a place. He says sit there. I didn\u2019t know that whole man, but I did what he said. Then he sat down opposite me. And he asked me to explain to him what faith meant to me. I thought that was strange, but good: I wanted to do that \u2013 and he listened very carefully. At one point the train stops, he shakes my hand and says: thank you for this conversation, I was at a crossroads in my life today. And then you start to think, then you think: this is a piece of practice of faith that is normally in the vague, about which you sometimes hear something, which is also in the Bible, but which you now experience yourself. I was caught by my guts, because I had to be there at that moment. Exactly at that moment I had to help that man further.\u201d\nI don\u2019t have to do it all myself, there are powers that stand by me\nWhat experience would you like to share with someone looking at your church interiors?\n\u201cThe atmosphere, the meditative. But also the space and the light. I want you to experience a certain peace. And that you can think a bit: why is that church there, what does faith mean.\u201d\nCan you still sit in a church without thinking about light and proportions?\n\u201cIf I have no intention of painting, I can. But I do have a professional deformity, even at those moments I dissect everything in lines.\u201d\nAnd where do you get your own meditative moments from?\n\u201cFrom prayer. Prayer is something that always works for me. It\u2019s also not that I tell a story out of nowhere, I regularly notice that there is contact at that moment. I also give thanks for all the good things out there, because I have a lot of privileges. And I ask for protection, for a good day. I start the day with prayer and I also end the day with a prayer, a prayer of thanks. I find that very soothing, like: I don\u2019t have to do it all myself, because there are powers that assist me. Faith is a reality in our lives that we experience every day.\u201d\nWork by Maarten \u2018t Hart can be seen on location from 8 to 17 September on Thursday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in De Schuur, Groot Oever 14, Balkbrug.", "Page: Profile: Group\n||Total Views: 16,027,365\nNew Members OK?: Yes\n501* Cert.?: No\nGroup Id: 25116\nPoster Id: 253790\nTotal Views: 2524\nMoon Sirens of the Ocean Star\nAge Range/Type: Family\nLocated in: Hooksett, New Hampshire\nKey Contact: Rev.

Also, the Armitage El stop doesn't yet have a station, nor does the Armitage shopping corridor east of there.\nSo 24 of the planned 44 stations in or bordering Lincoln Park are installed already.

The $2,200 increase prompted Brown to call the assessor\u2019s office and question the basis of her annual tax bill, which increased 44 percent, from $157 last year to $226 this year.\n\u201cI knew the tax rate was going up, so I didn\u2019t pay much attention at first,\u201d said Brown, 69. \u201cThen a neighbor asked me about my valuation and I was really surprised to see that my assessment went up, too.\u201d\nThe $69 tax increase was quite a hit to her already tight budget.\nBrown is among about a dozen mobile home owners who have questioned their assessments since the town computerized its annual appraisal of about 1,200 mobile homes, said Cathleen Donovan, town assessor.\nDonovan said her office has reviewed a handful of mobile home assessments at the request of homeowners but changed none, largely because any increases were made to reflect recent real estate sales.\n\u201cThe assessments might have changed, but their properties might have been undervalued,\u201d Donovan said, noting that any homeowner who disputes an assessment can request a review and an adjustment.\nAlthough there\u2019s no statewide tally of mobile homes, Bangor has 1,000, Lewiston has 541 and Lisbon has about 500, according to municipal officials.\nBrunswick has three large mobile home parks, Donovan said. Linnhaven Mobile Home Park and Maplewood Manor each has more than 300 trailers, she said, and Bay Bridge Estates has more than 400 trailers. One theory is that the proximity of the former Brunswick Naval Air Station may have played a role in the development of such large parks.\nDonovan said it\u2019s difficult to do a year-to-year comparison of individual mobile home values because 70 to 100 are sold each year and sometimes moved to different lots in town and within parks.\nThe total value of all mobile homes in Brunswick is $32.4 million, down $157,000 from $32.6 million in 2012, Donovan said.

This station is close to my home, and it's been fun to observe the huge rate of people undocking and re-docking bikes at all times of day, including leisure users on weekends and commuters during the workweek.

If you walk from the dirt track to the front door, you will pass a large vegetable garden \u2013 all in all there are about two hundred species of plants and trees around the house. In the exhibition space: paintings and drawings that evoke the same, almost forgotten atmosphere as the house and garden. Flowers, fruits and small animals, but above all: old buildings. And of these, especially church interiors, realistically rendered, they are monumental spaces, you almost always see high pillars and round arches, white light falls through the windows over tiled floors.

You experience that immediately when you enter, you start to speak more softly. The Romanesque churches appeal to me the most than the Gothic ones. After that it quickly decreases. Classicism, baroque: it doesn\u2019t mean much to me.\u201d\n\u201cRomanesque churches are the simplest and therefore the strongest in terms of spatial effect. In the Gothic it becomes a bit looser and you get more light, which I like by the way. It is only less concentrated light, they are often whole puddles. In Romanesque light you have those small light traps on the floor and against the walls, which are often also a bit mysterious.\u201d\nIs it about the light?\n\u201cFor everything, really. Drawing is not just looking, it is also smelling and listening. The whole atmosphere of such a space, its sober and meditative. I also intentionally don\u2019t paint people in it. And no images either, I leave them out if they disrupt the lines, sometimes they are just too kitschy. In an empty church you become focused on the space and the light. Everything around it just distracts.\u201d\nJust like modern life distracts. Maarten and Annelies (67) \u2018t Hart have three grown children who grew up in this place. There was and is no mobile phone. And no car either, there are two bicycles in the shed. They eat vegetarian, much comes from the garden. Homemade bread is served with the soup. And no camera is involved in making the paintings, no matter how realistic they look.\nHow it goes: \u201cBefore I make the painting at home, I sketch the interior in the church. And as I do that, I mathematically compare all the elements I see. I have a small stick for that, a thin brush from which the hairs have been removed. I first hold that baton horizontally in front of my eyes.\u201d\nHe takes a stick and shows it. \u201cFor example, if I were to measure the shed here in the garden, where I now put my thumb is the end of the wall. Then I turn the stick vertically, look like this. Now I see that the shed is just a little higher than it is wide. In this way I go through the entire interior of a church, so that later all proportions in the painting are correct.\u201d\nAt the same time you omit things, such as those images of saints. Or you can replace stained glass windows with white glass windows.\n\u201cI do that for the atmosphere, but also because the composition then becomes better: it is not always good. Then you think: it is very beautiful here, but those pillars should be a bit closer together. Sometimes a certain wall is very bare, I think there should be a niche in it. Or: I\u2019m going to move that window a b", "What is the significance of the agreement between SALON Suite and Salon Plaza according to Gary Ratner", "What burdens does Piper carry in addition to her past encounters", "What is the primary location for registration and where many old timers stay during the yearly event", "What prompted Sharon Brown to question her property tax assessment", "During installation or over time, millwork can become damaged with dings and gouges that come with wear.

The use of gonadal steroids pre-dates their identification and isolation. Medical use of testicle extract began in the late 19th century while its effects on strength were still being studied.\nIn the s, it was already known that the testes contain a more powerful androgen than androstenone , and three groups of scientists, funded by competing pharmaceutical companies in the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, raced to isolate it. The chemical synthesis of testosterone was achieved in August that year, when Butenandt and G. Wettstein, announced a patent application in a paper \"On the Artificial Preparation of the Testicular Hormone Testosterone Androstenoneol.\nClinical trials on humans, involving either oral doses of methyltestosterone or injections of testosterone propionate , began as early as Kennedy was administered steroids both before and during his presidency. The development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters.\nIn response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.\nIt was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those having abused Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Androgens were discovered in the s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic i.\nAlthough anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone itself.\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: Unlawful distribution or possession with intent to distribute AAS as a first offense is punished by up to ten years in prison. Those guilty of buying or selling AAS in Canada can be imprisoned for up to 18 months. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. A study conducted in by the Canadian Centre for Drug-Free Sport found that nearly 83, Canadians between the ages of 11 and 18 use steroids.\nAAS are readily available without a prescription in some countries such as Mexico and Thailand. The history of the U. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone.\nBy the early s, after AAS were scheduled in the U. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone other than estrogens , progestins , and corticosteroids that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of , which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances , with effect from January 20, In the United Kingdom, AAS are classified as class C drugs for their illegal abuse potential, which puts them in the same class as benzodiazepines.\nPart 1 drugs are subject to full import and export controls with possession being an offence without an appropriate prescription. There is no restriction on the possession when it is part of a medicinal product. Part 2 drugs require a Home Office licence for importation and export unless the substance is in the form of a medicinal product and is for self-administration by a person. Many other countries have similar legislation prohibiting AAS in sports including Denmark,  France,  the Netherlands  and Sweden.\nUnited States federal law enforcement officials have expressed concern about AAS use by police officers. It's not that we set out to target cops, but when we're in the middle of an active investigation into steroids, there have been quite a few cases that have led back to police officers,\" says Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. Following the murder-suicide of Chris Benoit in , the Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigated steroid usage in the wrestling industry.\nThe documents stated that 75 wrestlers\u2014roughly 40 percent\u2014had tested positive for drug use since , most commonly for steroids. AAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad.\nAs with most significant smuggling operations, organized crime is involved. In the late s, the worldwide trade in illicit AAS increased significantly, and authorities announced record captures on three continents. In , Finnish authorities announced a record seizure of A year later, the DEA seized In the first three months of , Australian customs reported a record seizures of AAS shipments.\nIllegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians. AAS, alone and in combination with progestogens , have been studied as potential male hormonal contraceptives. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about androgens as medications.

When town leaders reduced her staff from four to three workers, it became clear that it was time to further streamline appraisals and include mobile homes among the more than 9,500 taxable properties in the town\u2019s database of computerized assessments, she said.\nDonovan mailed letters in April to all mobile home owners letting them know that members of her staff would be visiting mobile homes in May to measure each one and take note of exterior decks, screened rooms and sheds. They also would take photos of each home but wouldn\u2019t go inside.\nDonovan attributed some concern about higher tax bills to a higher tax rate, which increased 6.6 percent this year, from $24.90 to $26.54 per $1,000 of assessed property value. She also noted that the town assesses properties below market value.\nDonovan said mobile homes depreciate significantly in the first few years and tend to level off, especially if they\u2019re well-maintained and in a good location, such as a well-maintained park.\n\u201cMobile homes do depreciate over time, but a lot depends on what happens in the market,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them appreciate and I\u2019ve seen them depreciate.\u201d\nThe assessed value of Brown\u2019s single-wide mobile home has fallen and recovered since she bought it in 2000. It was first appraised at $30,000 and assessed at $27,000 (90 percent of market value) in 2001. The assessed value gradually fell to $16,800 in 2007, then rose to $17,500 in 2012. This year, the appraisal based on comparable sales is $28,145 and the assessed value (70 percent of market value) is $19,700.\nAfter the town applied a $7,000 homestead exemption and a $4,200 veteran\u2019s exemption, Brown paid taxes on $8,500 in property value, or $226.\nBrown acknowledged that her tax bill might seem small to others, and that her $470 combined monthly mortgage and lot rental payment is quite low.

A study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. There have been anecdotal reports of depression and suicide in teenage steroid users,  but little systematic evidence.\nA review found that AAS may both relieve and cause depression, and that cessation or diminished use of AAS may also result in depression, but called for additional studies due to disparate data. Androgens such as testosterone , androstenedione and dihydrotestosterone are required for the development of organs in the male reproductive system , including the seminal vesicles , epididymis , vas deferens , penis and prostate.\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action.\nThe pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor AR located in the cytoplasm of that cell. From there, the compound hormone-receptor diffuses into the nucleus, where it either alters the expression of genes  or activates processes that send signals to other parts of the cell.\nThe effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles.\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: Some examples of the anabolic effects of these hormones are increased protein synthesis from amino acids , increased appetite, increased bone remodeling and growth, and stimulation of bone marrow , which increases the production of red blood cells. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles , leading to increased strength.\nThe androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. Processes affected include pubertal growth, sebaceous gland oil production, and sexuality especially in fetal development. Some examples of virilizing effects are growth of the clitoris in females and the penis in male children the adult penis size does not change due to steroids [ medical citation needed ] , increased vocal cord size, increased libido , suppression of natural sex hormones , and impaired production of sperm.\nMen may develop an enlargement of breast tissue, known as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and a reduced sperm count. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy e. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic: The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect.\nTwo or more batches of rats are castrated and given no treatment and respectively some AAS of interest. Animal studies also found that fat mass was reduced, but most studies in humans failed to elucidate significant fat mass decrements. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. Both muscle hypertrophy and the formation of new muscle fibers have been observed.\nThe hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. After drug withdrawal, the effects fade away slowly, but may persist for more than 6\u201412 weeks after cessation of AAS use. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press.\nThe measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple although arguably unsophisticated and outdated model involving rat tissue bioassays. The intracellular metabolism theory explains how and why remarkable dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects can occur despite the fact that these effects are mediated through the same signaling receptor, and of course why dissociation is invariably incomplete. An animal study found that two different kinds of androgen response elements could differentially respond to testosterone and DHT upon activation of the AR.\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic\u2014androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. Testosterone can be metabolized by aromatase into estradiol , and many other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well.\nThe major effect of estrogenicity is gynecomastia woman-like breasts. AAS are androstane or estrane steroids.

The department views ``the resolution of child custody disputes [as] a private legal matter in which the Department of State may not properly intervene,'' says a document it provides to parents of children missing abroad.\nThe department's role is limited to issues of the welfare and whereabouts of US children overseas, and to the question of whether passports should be issued to children in the midst of custody disputes.\nIn general, which parent gets custody of an American child abducted overseas depends on the law of the country to which he or she is taken; US laws do not apply.\nSome children, like Dustan, are eventually returned to their custodial parent in the US. The State Department says it knows of 265 children who have been retrieved this year.\nBut ``parental kidnapping, for the most part, is not internationally extradictable at this time,'' says Janet Kosid, director of legal technical assistance of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington, D.C.\nIn a few years a new international agreement should make it much easier for parents in the US to retrieve their children from several, mostly European, nations that have ratified it. It would make a 180-degree turn in customary procedure in international child custody cases; it provides that a child should be returned to the nation in which he or she usually lives, and that the custody laws and rulings of that country should apply.\nCalled the Hague Convention, it was hammered out in 1984. Eight Western nations, primarily in Western Europe, have ratified it. About half of all American children taken overseas go to these nations.\nThe US, however, has not yet fully agreed to the treaty. The Senate has ratified it, but the House has yet to pass enabling legislation that would spell out precisely how it would be applied.\nEven when all these nations become full signatories, large areas of the globe will present serious potential difficulties. ``The problem areas,'' says Ms. Kosid, ``are going to be the Middle Eastern countries'' where there is little interest in joining, and from which it is very difficult to retrieve children, if they can indeed be located. The cultures and laws of many Middle Eastern and developing nations give fathers far more rights in the custody of children than mothers, which poses challenges to any American mother whose child is abducted to such a nation.\nNonetheless, says Mrs. Carroll, a parent whose child is taken abroad should not surrender, but should persist in the effort to achieve the child's return to the custody and community a court has ruled appropriate.", "What are some of the types of grants mentioned that the government provides to support specific groups in the community", "What are the main kinds of effects that anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) have on the body", "What did French economy minister Christine Lagarde say about the difference between Eurozone and US interest rates", "What television shows or moments are mentioned in the text segment", "ing mad over an encounter with Piper six years earlier.\nReturning to roots that are dark, roots that are secret, and roots that lead to an uncertain future, Piper finds out the past is not the heaviest burden to carry.

John Doe cases are secret proceedings in which witnesses can be subpoenaed and compelled to testify under oath about potential criminal matters...\n\"I have not been contacted personally,\" the governor said. \"In terms of anything with the campaign, I mean there were questions asked about stuff that was brought up earlier in the year with (former county staffer) Darlene Wink, like six months - actually, it was, like, nine or 10 months ago. But nothing that has been brought up recently, nothing that involves me directly.\"\nThe probe was launched at about the same time Wink quit her county job as Walker", "Seven-year-old Dustan Dinshaw spent an old-fashioned Christmas in America last week. He went to his grandparents' farm in Millington, Mich., where he played with his cousins and went ice skating and sledding. That may not seem remarkable, but it was. Dustan nearly spent this Christmas, and many more, in India, where he lived early this year for five months. He is one of a small but apparently growing number of children who are spirited out of the United States by a parent in custody battles, in violation of US court orders.\nGetting him back to the US required months of effort by his mother and maternal grandparents, a good deal of money, a skilled lawyer, and approval by an Indian court.\nA modest number of such children are, like Dustan, found and returned to the US. Others are discovered, but courts in the country to which they have been taken permit the abducting parent to keep them in their new country, US court orders notwithstanding. Some children simply go abroad and vanish.\nLiterally no one knows how many children are taken abroad. No one even knows how many American children are kidnapped - the once oft-repeated figure of 50,000 abductions a year is now dismissed as far too high - let alone how many are spirited abroad.\nThe US State Department says that since 1973 it has participated in 2,312 international child-custody cases. Most of them apparently have arisen since 1980, when the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs was established and it became known that the department would provide modest help to Americans whose children have been abducted overseas. ``There may be a slow increase,'' says the department's Jenny Foo, ``but it may be because more people are aware of our services. It's hard to tell if there actually are more cases.''\nJeff McFarlane, a staff member of the House Human Resources Subcommittee, which has probed the situation, says flatly that there are ``an increasing number of these cases.''\nGeorgia Hilgeman, executive director of the Vanished Children's Alliance, says there are ``hundreds and hundreds if not thousands'' of such international abductions. ``I'd say about 2 to 3 percent of all parentally abducted children are out of the country.'' Like some other people involved in the child abduction issue, she has had personal experience: Her child was in Mexico for 4 years before she was able to locate and retrieve him.\nFor five months early this year young Dustan was the object of an international custody battle. A Michigan court had awarded custody to his mother, but last January his father, an Indian national, spirited him to India.\nBut his mother and her parents were determined to regain custody. They learned all they could about such cases, went to India, and hired an Indian lawyer.
