Many Freedom of information Act requests have been made to the FBI\nconcerning these personal goods of Nikola Tesla, especially concerning the\nnotes and books, and these requests, numbering in the hundreds or even\nthousands - have come up empty.\nThere are some of Tesla's private communications\nand publications among the public though, and most of these papers are\nextremely collectible and valuable.\nThe United States Navy is mentioned several times within the heavily\nredacted FBI records of Nikola Tesla, as well as among many other references\nto Tesla's work, up to and including the modern HAARP program, which will be\ncovered in some depth later.\nThe overall conclusion most researchers have drawn is that Tesla\u2019s work was\nfirst buried, then developed clandestinely by secret groups within the\ngovernment of the United States. There is a lot of evidence for this\nproposal; judging from other cases concerning government experimentation in\nmind control and behavior modification, a reader/researcher may at least\nbegin to see that this is the way the United States government generally\noperates, while spouting a creed of DENY DENY DENY, even when faced with\nproof positive of their activities.\nBecause this is the same government which writes\nthe laws, they naturally exempt themselves from any kind of accountability\nthat way as well. A police state cannot occur without a secrecy regime\nFortunately for us, Nikola Tesla did a pretty good job of making most of his\nwork publicly known in books, magazines and patents before his death, in\nspite of the fact that most people found his work incomprehensible while he\nwas alive. It is now possible to do a little reading, and get a decent\npicture of what has happened, and what is just beginning to happen after all\nthese years again.\nTesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia in 1865, and he showed intellectual\nrestlessness, some say precociousness, at an early age. Tesla's father was a\nclergyman, and had planned a life in the priesthood for his son, though\nNikola prevailed upon him for advanced schooling in what he loved: machinery\nand electricity; eventually he was allowed to pursue an engineering degree\nat the Technical University at Graz Austria, and the University of Prague.\nIn 1882 Tesla traveled to Paris France, where he\nfound work with the Continental Edison Company. It was there Tesla began\nvisualizing motors powered with alternating current (AC).\nAt that time direct current (DC) was all the\nrage, being used by the world entire to power experiments and new\ninventions, even though DC was dangerous and inefficient compared to\nalternating current. Nobody wanted to hear about improvements from a young\nsuper-unknown such as Nikola Tesla, so the young scientist did what any good\nmaverick would do: he split the scene for better opportunities elsewhere.\nTesla came to America in 1884, and for a short time he worked with Thomas\nEdison himself, but the two did not see things eye to eye at all, and Tesla\nquickly left the Edison Labs. He soon proved his superiority in certain\naspects of the electrical sciences though, and went on to develop patents in\nhis own name, which later became a large part of the Westinghouse\nCorporation, and more.\nMany of Tesla's patents went without development\nin his later years, and Nikola Tesla died in 1943 with some of his later\ninventions never being realized, except on paper. Some of the inventions by\nNikola Tesla that were developed are the polyphase induction (Electric)\nmotor, neon and fluorescent lights, the automobile ignition system, and 2 &\n3 phase alternating current.\nNikola Tesla was also responsible for almost all wireless technologies.\nThough Marconi is given credit for the radio, it was Tesla who actually\ndeveloped the science and patented it, along with other novel and powerful\nwireless technologies. From The Journal of The International Tesla Society,\nPower and Resonance, vol. 6, no. 4:\n\"Tesla's most important work at the end of\nthe nineteenth century was his original system of transmission of energy\nby wireless antenna. In 1900 Tesla obtained two fundamental patents (#\u2019s\n645,576 and 649,6212) on the transmission of true wireless energy\ncovering both methods and apparatus and involving the use of four tuned\nIn 1943 (3 months after Tesla's death -\nEd.), the Supreme Court of the United States granted full patent rights\nto Nikola Tesla for the invention of the radio, superseding and\nnullifying any prior claim by Marconi and others in regards to the\n\"Fundamental Radio Patent\"...\"\nA dream of Nikola Tesla was free wireless power\nfor the world.\nThis was the main reason behind the construction\nof his various and well known (Wardenclyffe/Colorado Springs) antennae, but\nit was also to be his ultimate undoing, because it discouraged his two main\nfinanciers, George Westinghouse, of the Westinghouse Electric Company, and\nJ.P. Morgan; both were heavily vested in metered electricity-for-money\nThese same people then invited him to invent\nmilitary weapons technologies as a means to further financing, although this\nwent against the scientists basic ideals. Later he became so strapped for\nmoney that he began thinking along these lines, but by then he had scared\nthe moguls of finance so badly they wanted nothing to do with him.\nOne of the Tesla inventions (Patent 1,119,732) designed to create wireless\npower resulted in what he called his Magnifying Transmitter, which has since\ncome to be called the Tesla Magnifying Transmitter, or TMT.\nTesla historian and", "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u00ab\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u2013 2015\u00bb My favorite poet \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0411\u041e\u0423 \u0421\u041e\u0428 7, \u0433. \u041c\u0438\u0447\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430. - \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430\n2 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0443: \" \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u00ab\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u2013 2015\u00bb My favorite poet \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0411\u041e\u0423 \u0421\u041e\u0428 7, \u0433. \u041c\u0438\u0447\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430.\" \u2014 \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442:\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u00ab\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u2013 2015\u00bb My favorite poet \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0411\u041e\u0423 \u0421\u041e\u0428 7, \u0433. \u041c\u0438\u0447\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\nWilliam Shakespeare 26 April 1564 \u2013 23 April 1616 His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays,154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, of which the authorship of some is uncertain.

I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks, And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.

Only in 1966 were most of his works republished. Today Yesenin's poems are taught to Russian schoolchildren; many have been set to music and recorded as popular songs. His early death, coupled with unsympathetic views by some of the literary elite, adoration by ordinary people, and sensational behavior, all contributed to the enduring and near mythical popular image of the Russian poet.\nSilver road, I wonder where You are calling me anew?

Among Byron's best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and the short lyric She Walks in Beauty.\nShe walks in Beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that's best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes: Thus mellowed to that tender light Which Heaven to gaudy day denies. One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impaired the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress, Or softly lightens o'er her face; Where thoughts serenely sweet express, How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent!\nAnna Akhmatova 23 June 1889 \u2013 5 March 1966 She was a Russian modernist poet, one of the most acclaimed writers in the Russian canon. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.\nI crave for the roses and garden my best, Thats clad in the best in the word airy fence.

(14)\nIt is also understood by most Tesla researchers that Schumann in fact only\nRediscovered this resonance; some of Nikola Tesla's experiments indicate\nthat not only was he aware of it, he actually employed it, harnessing it for\nhis own use during high power wireless experiments.\nThe lightning energies produced at the Colorado\nlaboratory are just one indication of this.\nBecause this resonance has been constantly altered by the many atmospheric\nexperiments involving nuclear explosions etc., there is no doubt that it has\neffected all life on the planet below, and also no doubt that this was\nobserved by the experimenters, at least over periods of time, through\nstatistics of disease, mental illness, increased crime, crop failures,\ndrought, etc. etc.. (15)\nToday we have to come to grips with the fact\nthat overexposure to Electromagnetic Radiation causes a great number of the\nills within our society, especially among children.\nOne example just coming to light: many science\ngroups have issued stark warnings against children using cell phones, and in\ncertain places in Asia cell towers are restricted from being anywhere near\nschools. Microwave overexposure has been indicated in the ever increasing\ncases of autism among children and bipolar disorder has almost exactly the\nsame symptoms as over exposure to EM energy as well.\nScalar electromagnetic processes, which utilize interfering\nenergy zones and fields on vast scales, are becoming a well known cause of\ngastric disorders, fractured thought, untreatable biological disruption at\nthe molecular level, and much more. It should be noted and Highlighted that\nthe Russians began a lot of these experimentations before America did.\nThe early wireless broadcasting experiments like Argus, and the twenty or\nthirty other unclassified tests during the 50's 60's and 70's (11),\nliterally caused the government to speed up its efforts to act even more\nirresponsibly, for some reason. Perhaps the government agencies became\nenthused with the mind control aspects of these experiments, the virtual\nstunning of the life below with invisible but gigantic energies, and/or the\nmanipulation of a resonant frequency humans had evolved to over many\nDisrupted quickly as it has been, in the last\ntwo decades especially, its a wonder anyone can still think, let alone act,\nfor the betterment of the overall situation here.\nThese foolish experimenters in our government may just be a bunch of\ndiabolical ghouls, or they may just be stupid as hell. Or both. One way or\nanother, the early experiments in broadcasting electromagnetic energy seemed\nonly to whet the appetites of these maniacs, and we are now in the fifth or\nsixth generation of this planetary alteration program.\nIt continues at an ever increasing pace.\nThere is much more concerning the military\u2019s interest in broadcast\ntechnology for environmental modification, communication, and silent\ninvisible weaponry in the following chapters.\nThe above is mentioned to illustrate the fact\nthat even though there appears to be an hiatus between Nikola Tesla's work,\nand later experiments beginning in the 1950\u2019s, broadcast technology was not\nforgotten, and just became larger in scope and use, though hidden as top\nsecret technologies of control.\nThis natural progression of Nikola Tesla's work was in fact the development\nof much more powerful antennae, even unconventional antennae: the\nperpetuation of Tesla's work in the conventional arena have taken place as\nwhat are known as phased arrays, where many antennae are used in concert,\nfor various purposes, not least of which is called Ionospheric Heating.\nLater, antennae technologies went really macro\nonce plasma sciences were employed, so that broadcast and satellite enabled\nactive-auroras could augment the more conventional antennae systems via\nreflection, redirection, and amplification of signals.\nAll that comes later though. For now we are still studying the earliest\ntypes of broadcast technologies, and that is rather limited to the type of\nantenna most people are familiar with, meaning the dishes or myriad other\nconfigurations mounted on poles or towers. The type of antennae that are\nfairly permanent, and rigid in the their physical aspects.\nMany are receivers (Monopoles), some are used to\nboth broadcast and receive (Dipole).\nOne of the latest incarnations of conventional\nbroadcast antennae systems is known as\nwhich is an acronym for High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program.\nThese latter day conventional antennae types are\nknown mostly for their ability to act together, many parts as one single\nentity, in what is known as a phased array. These arrays are sometimes found\nin close proximity to one another; that configuration is known as an\nAntennae Farm. That means many antennae in a small area, perhaps even in the\nThese antennae in phased array will be computer\ncontrolled and synchronized to create certain conditions within the\nenvironment. Many researchers now believe, by simple virtue of prudence and\npast actions, that a large number of the antennae strewn throughout all the\ncities of the world are actually phased array, on a very large scale.\nComputer control of these emitters is very easy to achieve, and the\noperators would actually be remiss if they had not accomplished this, if for\nno other reason than to create backup systems in case of failures of one or\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles, which are becoming\nvery popular as law enforcement devices, are directed with broadcast energy\nThey too are a very large part of the overall\nsurveillance/behavior modification system.\nGWEN Loves HAARP\nTo some people, the HAARP antennae\ntechnology is a logical extension of another, earlier antennae network\ndevised and deployed by the U.S. Government during the 1980's, known as the\nGWEN stands for Ground Wave Emergency Network,\nand it consists of a system of towers with extensive radiate forms copper\nwire, each wire 100 feet long, extending outward from the base of each tower\nbelow the ground.\nThese GWEN towers are spaced 200 miles apart\nacross the northern areas of America. These are part of a plan called\nContinuance of Government, a program to keep government in place in the\nevent of a nuclear attack or natural disaster. Like the HAARP project there\nis more here than meets the eye, though. One of the main bloopers in the\nexplanation given by the government concerning GWEN is that the towers would\nsurely be destroyed in any protracted nuclear conflict.\nThis was noted by the director of the program\nitself. GWEN towers are also subject to damage by Electromagnetic pulse;\nthose two factors illustrate graphically that the Government Continuance\nscenario of GWEN lacks plausibility in the extreme. (16)\nMany researchers have stated openly that GWEN serves one purpose and one\npurpose only, which is the entrainment of a subject populations thought\nprocesses. Some very heavy hitters in the electro-medical field, such as\nRobert O. Becker M.D., Author of The Body Electric, made the statement\n\"GWEN is a superb system, in combination\nwith Cyclotron Resonance (HAARP) for producing behavioral alterations in\nthe civilian population.\"\nMore than a few researchers think that Gwen and\nHAARP are closely related, in that they are just two parts of one program.\nThis remains to be seen, but many details and\nknown information does point to just that. The real goal of the combined\nprograms seems to be a single nefarious weapon used clandestinely against\nthe entire population of the United States, and even the world.\nThe first unclassified HAARP installation took place in the wilds of Alaska,\nvery near the same place Tesla had formulated as being best for pumping the\nworld full of usable energy in a wireless grid.\nOperated by various corporate entities like\nPhillips Laboratory and Atlantic Richfield Corporations subsidiaries for the\nUnited States Air Force and Navy, the program has always been labeled\nexperimental, in spite of overt statemen", "Bloom resigns as lawyer for embattled movie mogul Weinstein\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Attorney Lisa Bloom says she is no longer representing movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as he confronts sexual harassment allegations.\nBloom posted on Twitter that she has resigned as an adviser to Weinstein.

Because there\u2019s no mention of the issue on the front page that their customers visit. Instead they will need to find the link buried away in their press release section.\nBut when you dig into the details of this particular breach, and its public disclosure, you find things are actually a lot worse.\nFirstly, this wasn\u2019t a breach involving a small number of customers. Paddy Power believes that the personal details of almost 650,000 customers (649,055 if we\u2019re being precise) were put at risk by hackers who broke into the company\u2019s computer systems.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gambling customers who have been exposed to more risk than perhaps they feel comfortable with.\nSecondly, although financial information such as credit card details were not compromised (thank goodness) there was an awful lot of information which was - including customers\u2019 names, usernames, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and \u201cprompted question and answer\u201d.\nEven though no passwords were grabbed by the hackers, there are still plenty of ways in which fraudsters and online criminals could exploit the information which has been exposed. For instance, it\u2019s simple to imagine carefully crafted emails could be sent to customers (using the personal information taken from the stolen user database to make them appear more convincing) that could be designed to trick innocent victims into revealing more details about themselves, or clicking on dangerous links that could put their computers and their financial information at greater risk.\nThirdly, Paddy Power is at pains to point out that the incident has \u201cno impact on customers who opened accounts after 2010\u201d.\nNow, you may think that\u2019s good news - but dig a little deeper into the story and the truth tumbles out.\nYou see, Paddy Power first identified that it had been hacked back in 2010.\nIn its own words:\n\u201cPaddy Power had detected malicious activity in an attempted breach of its data security system in 2010. A detailed investigation was undertaken at the time and determined that no financial informa", "How Beautiful the Ordinary , edited by Michael Cart, is a welcome addition to the small but growing collection of young adult fiction exploring gender identity and sexual orientation. Being a young person is difficult, what with all the changes physical, emotional, and social. Most of us spend our whole lives getting to know ourselves, and those initial explorations in our youth are some of the most confusing and painful (and exhilarating and profound) because they are so new. All of this can be overwhelming, and when you throw in societal condemnation of some of these identities and/or lifestyles it is especially hard. This collection of short fiction by well-respected young adult authors takes a loving and unrelenting look at the struggle not only to discover what we are as young women and men, but to accept and own that identity as well.\n\"My Virtual World\" by Francesca Lia Block chronicles the ways in which online connections can serve to safely hide or reveal one's true self. Through a series of increasingly open instant messages, two young people struggling with depression find acceptance and in turn learn to accept themselves. Ariel Schrag and Eric Shanower contribute a humorous look at gay pride events and the pangs of a secret high school love, respectively, in graphic novel format. Poetic verse (Julie Anne Peters' intimate \"The First Time\") and screenplay (Ron Koertge's experimental story of a gay son's coming out to his father) also add variety to the collection.

In a recent interview with Horse Network, performance coach, Steve Morris, of Morris Coaching in Calgary, Alberta says that the body is put under strain when a person has some muscles that are too short and some that are too long.

Why is your back hurting? \u201c90% of the time it\u2019s because your hip flexors are too tight, particularly in combination with tight hamstrings,\u201d reveals Morris. By targeting these areas with pre- and/or post-ride stretching, you can help prevent muscle tearing and support the joints.\nFor hamstrings, Steve suggests combining a moving stretch with a stationary stretch.

Ryan now provides the \"WTF\" moment of the season, announcing Tuesday he plans to start Greg McElroy -- the third string QB -- instead of Tim Tebow.\nThis bizarre decision will surely prompt conspiracy theorists to wonder if there is some behind the scenes payoff being offered to keep Tebow off the field. Because, really? McElroy? Really.\nESPN reports Ryan has no good explanation for the mysterious move, telling reporters, \"I can answer this question a million ways -- frontward, backward, sideways, anything else.

Sometimes these young quarterbacks don't learn to throw the ball away. He's growing, but I think his best is still ahead of him.\n\"He's a fighter and tough guy, but it's learning to play smart at that position.\"\nWebb has been staying at a Boulder hotel this month as he settles in at CU and starts to learn the offense and get to know teammates. He is participating in player organized throwing sessions and 7-on-7. He said one of the big early adjustments has been getting used to Nike balls after spending three years in Kansas throwing Wilson balls.\nWebb said some of his interceptions at Kansas were fluky, but he acknowledges he has to do a better job of taking care of the ball if he hopes to earn the starting job with the Buffs. One of the primary reasons CU coaches chose Tyler Hansen as their starter last season was because he didn't throw interceptions during scrimmages in spring and fall camp.\n\"That's the number one job of the quarterback,\" Webb said. \"If you're not able to take care of the ball, you're probably not going to be playing too long. If you look back on the (2011) stats, I don't think I threw my first interception until the fourth game. It's hard to say that's the number one thing I'm working on because I'm working on everything, but decision making is obviously up there.\"\nWebb played in a spread offense at Kansas and was asked to run the ball at times. He said the CU pro style offense is very different from a formation and terminology standpoint, but there are concepts and routes within the scheme that are essentially the same.\nHe said his biggest challenge between now and the time camp opens and the competition starts is learning the offense. He doesn't want coaches to have to dumb down the offense when he's taking repetitions. Webb said Colorado coaches have asked him to take a leadership role and be assertive.\nSo, considering Webb has played in 21 college games with more than a dozen starts and only one other CU quarterback has college experience (sophomore Nick Hirschman), shouldn't he be the starter?\n\"I would like to think that would be the case, but nothing has been guaranteed to me,\" Webb said. \"What it's going to come down to is that fall camp and having a grasp of the offense, taking control in the huddle and really asserting myself as a leader.\"\nLong isn't making any predictions because he doesn't know a lot about the other quarterbacks on Colorado's roster, but he does believe that Webb's experience and the fact that the other Buffs are still wet behind the ears favors Webb.\n\"He's very tough,\" Long said. \"He's one of the tougher guys that I've coached. He's got very good mechanics and he's got a very strong arm. He has some athleticism to him. He can run the ball as well. I think his best trait is he's an excellent competitor.\"", "What percentage of employees report experiencing high levels of stress according to the survey, and how does this differ for those in management positions", "What relationship did the athlete develop with Churandy after he accepted the medal", "What were some of the notable aspects of James Herold Ough's life and family", "(22%) of employees report experiencing high levels of stress.

He said CU coaches are getting a mature player who has been through the fire.\n\"He basically has one year of starting under his belt, and I think right now he's a young man who will begin to come in to his own in the next couple years,\" Long said. \"He's poised and ready to take it to the next step. That was kind of the path we had him on. I know he's in good hands with the coaching staff there. I think you will see Jordan blossom.\"\nLong left Kansas after last season when head coach Turner Gill was fired after going 5-19 in two seasons at the helm of a program that played in a BCS bowl game in the 2007 season. Webb played in many of those games over the two years under Gill and Long and brings much more experience to the table than any of the young quarterbacks on the CU roster, even though it's losing experience.\nWebb will be able to compete for the starting job when fall camp opens Aug. 7 because he earned his degree at KU, making him eligible under NCAA rules without having to sit out a year.

It doesn't surprise Long that Webb found a way to make it happen.\n\"He will make the position very competitive,\" Long said.\nLong said when Webb first joined the Kansas program out of high school in St. Louis, it took him awhile to learn to become a student of the game and to take all of his coaching to heart. Long said Webb made drastic improvements in those areas over the past two years.\nWebb completed 179 of 281 passes for 1,884 yards and 13 touchdowns with 12 interceptions last year. He has thrown 20 touchdowns and 20 interceptions to this point in his career, a fact that raised some skeptical eyebrows from CU fans who questioned why coach Jon Embree wanted add Webb to the roster.\nLong said Webb's high interception numbers at KU are the result of multiple factors. He said Webb never learned to throw the ball away in high school and it took him awhile to get used to the idea that it's OK to do so at the college level. He said Webb's competitive spirit sometimes led him to make poor decisions trying to make plays with his team often trailing by large deficits.

For if I confuse the two, my independent American sensibilities and the pursuit of my own individual rights will too often result in just the opposite being inflicted up those whom my Christian faith calls me to love and serve. If my citizenship trumps my faith, the pursuit of my own life, liberty and happiness will lead directly and indirectly to the death, oppression and despair for the stranger, the enemy, the prisoner, the poor, the outcast, the hungry and the oppressed.\nDoes this mean that I want the United States to become a theocracy governed by a less than unanimous understanding of the Christian faith, of course not. And are there times when my faith and citizenship align, sure. The big takeaway for this Christian, who cherishes the opportunities to dialogue about the politics and policies of our country, is that I must be open to solutions to complex issues that might indeed infringe upon my own independence and personal gain so others may thrive.

For instance, if your left side is tighter, go left, right, left so it equalizes better.
