But in a matter of months you came again in a new iteration.\nStanding in line for another midnight release, I was introduced to a new fellow gamer. We played multiplayer in your newest iteration that night and I was introduced to more good friends I have to this day. While your gameplay remained mostly static, I found some of the new features to be a pure joy, using one to recreate my favorite South Park characters...until I saw others using this to hump a pig...and a dog...and a horse.\nYour new single player story boggled my mind, using voices I could picture from other major entertainment. I never saw your twist coming and it was a joy to behold once, but it never happened again as I spent hours and hours playing your multiplayer.\nYet another year rolled around and yet another title was released. This time, you returned to your modern setting, hoping to close out a story that had become all too confusing. I demolished your single player experience in less than five hours and finished with an emotionless \"meh.\" It can be impossible to fix a disaster like the modern era's prior entry, so I cannot fault your single player for lacking any emotional gravity.\nYour multiplayer, yet again, was good, but was more of the same with a few welcome changes mixed in. The on-line competition continued to astound as newer gamers were born from your influence. But as I continued to play, I found myself wanting...more. But not more of you, I wanted more of something different. As I found my place within a new online community, I became exposed to many titles I had missed in the past while you and I were away killing the digital masses.\nHere we are, at the precipice of your next iteration and I just cannot see myself enjoying what you have to offer. We have shared many memories, you gave me my nickname and brought my brother and I together on a level we have never experienced before. But I want to kill redcoats with my new friend named Connor and the voices of Chief and Cortana are calling my name. There is much praise from those who have experienced the Chief's resurrection, I feel it may be the start of a new relationship between us.\nWhile I may rent you to experience your story, I cannot justify a continued affair together. You are still a great game and loved by so many. But, until one of us changes, our affair ends here. Your constant and frequent releases have become more annoying than a girlfreind or wife who can't learn to stop calling while I am at work, I need space to do my own thing and play other games.

This is an embarrassingly late 90s/early 2000s movie that has not aged well. That said, it\u2019s kind of brilliant in a weird way. Though it\u2019s underlying cleverness is too clever for its target audience.\nThis movie bombed when it was released, and it\u2019s not completely surprising. I grew up reading Archie comics, so I was casually acquainted with the Pussycats when this came out. None of my friends had any clue who these girls were. Not that resurrecting a forgotten cartoon is a bad idea, but I think there needs to be some level of name recognition to ensure success. Josie just doesn\u2019t have that, so the lines that directly reference the comics fall flat. The secondary characters who appear in the comics alongside Josie, Val, and Melody are only briefly introduced and serve little function to the plot. There\u2019s no character development and little connection to the source material.\nAnother big issue is that this movie can\u2019t seem to figure out who its audience is. Anyone old enough to actually know who Josie and the Pussycats are would likely find this incarnation vapid and annoying. I mean, Tara Reid pretty much spends the entire film braless and generally acts very Tara Reid-y. Most of the jokes are stupid and the characters are annoying. I just don\u2019t see people like my parents, who are the right age to have grown up reading Archie comics when they were first published, enjoying this movie at all.\nOn the other hand, there is a thin layer of intelligence throughout that would go completely over the heads of the tweens and teens this was marketed to. The entire plot posits that the government has been implanting subliminal messaging into popular music to bolster the economy, sending teens out to purchase the latest new trends. I doubt they\u2019d understand the irony of this, or the rampant product placement throughout the film (The movie actually received no payment from any of the brands shown on screen, which they probably regret given how little this made at the box office).\nTo be fair, Josie and the Pussycats is not the worst movie I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s not even the worst comic book adaptation I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s just not particularly good, despite being surprisingly clever. On the upside: the music is very catchy.\nThis film absolutely bombed when it was first released. This is not surprising, Josie and the Pussycats does not seem to know who its audience is.

As previosuly mentioned, AEM 6.4 code will continue to reference the old locations until the modifications are implemented as part of a customer release. While there is no forced timeline for which the changes should be made, it is recommended that they are made before the 6.5 upgrade since future features may rely on the new locations being referenced. Also, documentation for a given feature will by convention reference the new locations and it could thus be confusing if the old locations are still being used.\nWhile planning for an upgrade to AEM 6.4, the following per-solution pages should be referenced in order to assess the work effort:\nEach page contains two sections corresponding to the urgency of the necessary changes. Anything under the \"With 6.4 Upgrade\" section should be tackled as part of the AEM 6.4 upgrade project. Anything under the \"Prior to 6.5 Upgrade\" can be optionally deferred until post-upgrade.\nEach entry on the page includes a \"Restructuring guidance\" field, which details the recommended technical strategy for aligning with the new 6.4 respository model so that the new locations are referenced for content previously located under the /etc folder.

Because of this, it was common for formal AEM releases to overwrite custom code, configuration or content. In addition, customer changes sometimes overwrote AEM product code or content, breaking product functionality.\nBy clearly delineating hierarchies for AEM product code and customer code, these conflicts can be avoided.\nTo that end, beginning in AEM 6.4 and to be continued in future releases, content is being restructured out of /etc to other folders in the repository, along with guidelines on what content goes where, adhering to the following high-level rules:\n- AEM product code will always be placed in /libs, which must not be overwritten by custom code\n- Custom code should be placed in /apps, /content, and /conf\nImpact on 6.4 Upgrades\nWhen upgrading to AEM 6.4, a large subset of the content under /etc will be duplicated in other folders in the repository. These new locations are the preferred locations in which the content is referenced. However, every attempt has been made for the AEM 6.4 upgrade to be backwards compatible with the previous locations in the /etc folder and so in most cases the old locations will continue to be referenced by AEM code until changes are actively -- and in many cases manually -- made in a customer's application.

I love a bit of \u2018bling,\u2019 so when I saw the cute heart gem plugs at Kinky Desires, I simply had to get one!\nThe coloured gems on offer include purple, clear, magenta, turquoise and ruby. These plugs prove popular, as at the time of writing this review they are all sold out. When I purchased mine, the colour options were limited. I would have liked a purple one, but these were sold out so I went for turquoise instead. It is nevertheless stunning.\nHeart in my palm!\nAs for the plug itself, it is stainless steel and the dimensions on the website state\n75cm (surely a typo, seeing as the other measurements are millimetres, mm!), measuring from pointed tip to heart base,\n28mm presumably around the \u2018stem\u2019, and\n33mm across the heart base.\nI think it is more useful to know the circumference of the thickest part of the bulb, and by my trusty tape measure, this reads out at 85mm, (3 3/8 inches for imperialists). This was reassurin", "ould have sailed over many of the teeny bopping heads that Josie was marketed towards.\nThe plot of Josie and the Pussycats, based on the eighties animated show, involves a small town band of three girls, Josie (Rachel Leigh Cook), Melody (Tara Reid) and Valerie (Rosario Dawson) being discovered by a visiting record producer, Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) and set on the path to superstardom. Wyatt is looking for a new band to sell after his last boy band died in a mysterious plane crash. Turns out Wyatt and his boss (Parker Posey) are putting subliminal messages into their music and using it to sell products. Josie\u2019s band are the next band they plan to manipulate. When they begin to suspect something, Wyatt and his bosses use the band\u2019s jealousy over Josie\u2019s newfound popularity to try and tear them apart. Can Josie save her friends and put a stop to her producer\u2019s nefarious plot?\nThis film is a lot more intelligent than I gave it credit for. I really liked the idea of having subliminal messages hidden in popular music. I have often wondered how some things become popular and this is an interesting take on it. If there were hidden messages in my music telling people to love the Kardashians, I would totally believe it. How else does that awful family stay relevant?\nOutside of the above average plot, there is not much else here. Rachel Leigh Cook is cute as Josie, but is not given much to do, as is the case with her bandmates Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson. Although, according to the credits, they performed much of their songs from the film, so that is pretty impressive. Dawson has become one of my favourite actresses working today so I am glad Josie\u2019s failure did not impact her career too much.\nMy favourite part of this film was the boy band featured during the opening. They have managed to bring together a who\u2019s who of nineties supporting teen actors. Seth Green, Breckin Meyer and Donald Faison make up the boy band that suddenly find themselves expendable by their employers. Their small role is one of the film\u2019s highlights, particularly their tongue in cheek music video to the song \u2018Backdoor Lover\u2019. It is jokes like this that are wasted on this film\u2019s target audience, many of whom would not have appreciated something like this.\nI enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would. An intelligent premise is wasted on a target market unlikely to appreciate it and outside of Alan Cumming and Parker Posey, the rest of the cast feel like they are phoning it in.", "by Nancy Bestor\nIf you\u2019re a regular reader of our e-news briefs, you\u2019ll remember that one thing I was worried about on our recent Italy trip were the fees associated with using my iPhone abroad. Well it turns out I had good reason to worry. I took the phone in order to talk to our staff at Travel Essentials on a regular basis. I paid in advance for an international phone package and that worked great. I also paid for texting and that was also fine.

The crystal gem has several \u2018snowflake\u2019- like imperfections around the periphery. These are all purely cosmetic, and have no impact whatsoever on the feel of the plug whilst in use.\nBefore using this plug, I warmed up with a smaller silicone plug to stretch my tight anal opening, since I do not play with anal toys very often. When I was ready to use the Heart steel plug, I slathered it in water-based lube and gently eased it in. Entry was pretty comfortable, and once in, the narrow stem and flared heart base made sure it was not going to travel anywhere! Despite being smaller than my glass plugs, this little gem beauty felt reasonably filling, and made for a pretty view for my other half during sex.\nSince it is not overly thick, and I am somewhat tight vaginally, my other half did not notice much difference to my tightness during our play together. I did find it enjoyable having both holes filled, though, so I would happily use it during sex, or for solo-play with a dildo or vibrator.\nKinky Desires were kind enough to include a 20%-off card with my plug, so I will be buying more from this retailer in the future\u2026watch this space", "id 'How can I get them out and when can I start?'

Is the program falling apart? Is the end of Oregon\u2019s success coming to an end? Is it time to panic? Will the Ducks ever sign another 5-star again?\nWhoa! Slow down there buddy! This is NOT the collapse of Oregon football recruiting! Sure, Theo Howard, the 4-star wide receiver from California de-committed. He was a vocal leader that helped recruit others to Oregon \u2014 he is now having second thoughts about whether Eugene is too far from home. Then 4-star cornerback Troy Warner de-committed just trying to think things through to make sure he picks the right place for his four years in college. Even these two are not entirely lost and may end up signing with Oregon when all is said and done, but there is still optimism of a talent-laden class without them.\nWith the loss of Howard and Warner, that leaves Oregon with 12 commitments for 2016. This is still the highest amount of recruits Oregon has had before the kickoff of the first game in the fall. The Ducks are still in good shape with the athletes that are still firm with their verbal pledges. If anything, the loss of Howard\u2019s recruiting efforts has led to Jared Mayden stepping up in that leadership role and has given him incentive to begin his own legacy of aiding the recruiting success. So, obviously the program is not falling apart with over five months left until signing day.\nIt is not time to panic but time to look forward to the official visits to begin. We know of 12 official visits that will happen. I will list the visits that have been made known to me by the hard work done by our friends at Duck Territory for 247sports.com. One of the Oregon recruiting analysts, Justin Hopkins, has made extensive efforts to contact current and potentially committed players to get dates of the games each will attend. The list does include a few who are not committed to Oregon yet and likely to frequently change.\nThe busiest date at this point is October 10th, when the Washington State Cougars travel to Eugene. Five of the six listed are currently committed to the Ducks. Brady Breeze, Cameron McCormick, Mayden, Dillon Mitchell and LaMar Winston have penciled this particular game for their official visit. The only non-committed visitor will be 5-star Caleb Kelly for the WSU game. The Civil War on November 27th currently has three players arriving in Eugene on officials: Logan Bathke, Jacob Capra and Vavae Malepeai. Troy Dye will visit November 7th, and uncommitted candidates Andrew Fitzgerald and Javon McKinley are coming when Oregon takes on Cal.\nOnly Seth Green has opened up the USC game November 21st for his official, while Hunter Kampmoyer is going solo September 26th versus Utah. Two key dates for now will be September 5th when current Nebraska commit, quarterback Terry Wilson, will be in Eugene to watch Eastern Washington get a shot at potentially trying to stop its old quarterback who transferred in the offseason. Finally, the date I am most anxious for will be the game with Georgia State September 19th, when one of the most coveted players in the nation, Nigel Knott, plans to visit Eugene. The CB from Mississippi has announced that he will make his verbal commitment after this visit on September 23rd. Knott\u2019s father played for defensive back coach John Neal at Ole Miss years ago. My hope is that Knott is sufficiently blown away by the atmosphere and facilities and game day experience to desire the same tutelage as his pops.\nWith the loss of a top WR, Oregon has an official visit from another top WR in McKinley. Eugene will be his final visit before he announces his commitment at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl game on January 9th. For a long time, McKinley was considered all USC until the Trojans picked up a fifth WR pledge. Now Oregon must battle Notre Dame for McKinley\u2019s talents. Two other names that may replace Howard as a WR option if he\u2019s gone for good are N\u2019keal Harry and Tre Nixon. Harry will most likely stay in the heat of the South but has great height for snagging the ball from thin air. Nixon is a better fit in Oregon\u2019s offense with tremendous quickness and cutting abilities to avoid tackles.\nIf Warner doesn\u2019t stick with his initial commitment this may sway Knott even more with the potential to step in as", "What are the recommended perks for effectively using the Welgun", "What does a Flaskenstein groomsmen gift include", "What cheese was used in the arancini fried risotto balls instead of mozzarella", "What was a highlight of the WFAS 2015 international conference held in Toronto", "How does the Ketch Policy Center support customer privacy and data usage", "What is the central plot of the film 'Josie and the Pussycats'", "fe-Care Natural Fertility Program, a treatment program developed by her and Dr. Chen.

Yeah, we still laugh about that.\nBut, deep in my heart of hearts, I knew our love would not last. Something about your graphics and the gameplay just didn't add up to a lasting relationship. Sure, there was zombies, but once the world had found out you could sink under multiplayer maps and kill, I could not justify a continued affair, especially when your developer moved so slow to fix all of your problems. So, I went back to the age of modern combat, awaiting its next move and spending time with my newborn son.\nYou came back to me on a cold November night, as I waited until midnight for your release. I went home proud to own my own night vision goggles and to the prospect of playing you for a week straight as I took vacation time from work. But alas, your designers had not thought ahead and your Playstation 3 servers crashed and refused to reboot for two precious days. So, I manned up and played your single player experience only to be crushed by the worst and most confusing storyline I had ever heard. When your servers finally returned, I enjoyed once again fighting with modern weaponry, but quickly became angered by the glitching that was occurring. Happily, your current designer jumped right in and fixed the issues and I continued to play.\nSoon, I discovered that my brother had an affair going with you as well, but on the Xbox 360.

Another that might replace Warner is Isaiah Gilchrist, even though he\u2019s nearly a lock for Washington. However, one DB departure may open up a place for another in the form of a safety. Brandon Jones has expressed interest in Oregon being one of his five official visits. Jones may be that intelligent prep star that sees early playing time at Oregon staring him in the face and becomes the next 5-star to commit to the Ducks.\nIf I haven\u2019t offered enough encouragement for optimism yet, I have more to say regarding the potential for the 2016 class as a whole. First, Oregon is not finished handing out scholarship offers. Two important offers may come to WR Dylan Crawford and CB Jordan Parker. I\u2019m not saying these two would be Oregon locks but if they received the highly anticipated offer from Oregon, it would get their attention really fast. Two quarterbacks that may soon see offers headed their way are Hawaii\u2019s McKenzie Milton and local Oregonian Justin Herbert.\nThere is plenty of speculation regarding many others wanting to take an official visit to Eugene. At least two elite prospects that are currently committed to USC want to visit Oregon. A huge prize would be linebacker Mique Juarez who does it all for his high school team \u2014 even quarterback. Another is Keyshon Camp, a 4-star defensive tackle from Florida. He says to 247sports.com that he would fit well with Oregon\u2019s speed because he is quick for a defensive lineman. I would like to see Juarez pull a \u201cDeAnthony Thomas\u201d as a 5-star committed to USC but signing with Oregon in the end.\nMy final question is whether Oregon will be able to pull a 5-star prospect this next recruiting cycle. The answer is definitely unknown, however, there are options for Oregon to get a few shots at signing at least one in February. The three I\u2019ve mentioned who want to take an official visit to Eugene are Jones, Juarez and Kelly. Other 5-stars that have an offer from Oregon are unlikely to commit outside the SEC. Remember to keep in mind that the success of Oregon does not come from a big group of the highest rated prospects. The coaches are able to find and coach up\u201ddiamonds in the rough\u201d talent, getting more out of 3- and 4-stars than what the evaluators projected.\nOregon is not dropping out of the Pac-12 race any time soon. With more consecutive 9-win seasons than any school in the big five conferences, Oregon is in great shape with the development of the veterans and especially the true freshmen this fall. With the Heisman, the foundation is complete. Now it is time to soar to new heights and become a dynasty that wins national titles. If Howard or Warner chooses not to be a part of the best Duck years ever, so be it.\nSpecial thanks to Duck Territory at 247sports.com for sharing this information with FishDuck.com.

Jason studied English at Southern Oregon University and enjoyed cheering for the school\u2019s team, but longed for that major college game-day experience. That desire slowly blossomed into a fanatical passion for the national feel of college football, especially defending the Pac-12 while challenging conferences like the SEC to step up. He has spent five years expounding on the differences between the two conferences on his blog, buzzbrother2-pac10football.blogspot.com, set up solely for that purpose. Following the Ducks\u2019 recruiting progress in the off-season has made college football a year-round hobby for him.
