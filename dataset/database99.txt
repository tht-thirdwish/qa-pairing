Their trains are consistently late, are cancelled or miss stops.\n\u201cIt is not good enough. There has to be a fairer compensation system for passengers when delays occur.\n\u201cA fifteen-minute delay is still significant and so compensation should begin at that point rather than the current thirty minutes.\n\u201cWe should not allow for trains to be delayed for say 25 minutes without there being any consequence for Southeastern.\u201d\nIn response the rail minister said: \u201cIt is a manifesto commitment of my government, reiterated by the chancellor, to introduce in a relatively shor", "What does Dr. Andy recommend for getting support to play most video types in Windows Movie Maker", "Who has been your favourite actor or actress to work with and why", "What qualities is the individual looking for in a partner", "Thank you Delta Sigma Theta women for your patronage today at the 15th Annual Literary Luncheon featuring keynote speaker and best-selling author Walter Mosley!

The results are likely to vary from person to person, so consult your dentist if you\u2019re unsure.\nThankfully, the side effects of teeth whitening treatments are relatively minor.

There have been very few animal feeding studies of GE food to date, and extremely few that lasted longer than 90 days. This new study looked at pigs fed GE corn and soy under commercial production conditions over a 22.7 week period. Compared to a control group that was fed conventional corn and soy, the GE-fed pigs showed significant increases in severe stomach inflammation and thickening of the uterus. The study in online here: http://www.organic-\nConsumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, has long been concerned about the impact of GE crops and thinks these effects are a red flag and deserve further study. We also believe this study underlines the need for labeling of GE food, since there still much to learn about their health effects.

On his return, Claxton asked [him] if he heard King call him base rogue. Priddie replied, No, whereupon Claxton said, 'he would call [him] upon his oath, and throw him in jaile and keepe him there as long as he lived if [he] would not swear it'. Soon afterwards they all went homewards.\n3. He well knew Thomas Price, who for about a year was well known 'to be a mortal enemie of William King'. Last Christmas, Price told him that Mr Claxton 'had the king's broad seale to serve [Priddie] up to London, and [Priddie] asked him, For what, and he replyed, For to be a witness, and [Priddie] asked him, For what business, he said, For to testifie that King did call Mr Claxton base rascall rogue; and then [he] told Price that he could testifie no such words, and that he believed there were no such words spoken. Whereupon Price told [him] that he had heard King speak it, and withal persuaded [him] to goe to London and sweare itt, and told [him] that [he] should have a horse and money to beare his charges, and ride to London fortnight before the terme and there lye gentleman like... that in hay harvest last it was commonlie *and crediblie* spoken in Compton Dando and the countrie thereabouts that Thomas Price did beate and wound King with a peeked staffe and indangered his life; and as the report went he did it when he arrested King at the suit of Mr Hugh Claxton.'\n4.

The witness thought 'they would be easily drawne to depose an untruth on their oathes'. Before going to London to testify, Poole voluntarily swore to [Priddie] that he could not testify that King called Claxton 'base rascal rogue or that he spake any other abusive terms unto him, onlie he said that all that he said at the alehouse was that Mr Claxton called King whoremaster.' The witness had also heard that Claxton gave Monke half a crown to buy him a pair of shoes to go to London to testify in this business'.\nSigned by Nicholas Priddie [his mark], and by the two commissioners.\nfos. 231r-232r (Witness 3), Robert Horsington of Compton Dando, co.

Since last hay harvest, Price 'hath been and is a capital enimie of William King' because 'he swore a rescue against King when as to [Horsington's] knowledge, being present at the time when it was pretended the rescue was, there was no such rescue made. But to [his] knowledge in haie harvest last, in a cloase in the parish of Compton Dando, Thomas Price with a picked staffe fought with Kinge, and then at the tyme Kinge received a wound in his side; and [he] verily believeth Price gave him the wound'. On this occasion, Price had come to arrest King at Mr Claxton's suit.\n4.

Somerset\nNovember 1637 - November 1638\nClaxton prosecuted King for abusive words in Thomas Taylor's alehouse in Compton Dando, Somerset, at Whitsun in 1637. King admitted to the words in the libel, but claimed that he had spoken them after asking Claxton for security for a loan he was arranging for him and that he was provoked by Claxton calling him 'base drunken rogue' and striking him in the face. He also claimed Claxton's three main witnesses were 'base idle fellows', one of whom, his servant, Thomas Price, had wounded him with a pikestaff the previous summer when trying to arrest him at Claxton's suit and sworn against him in the Court of Common Pleas. Proceedings were under way by November 1637 and the defendant's witnesses were examined by a commission led by John Burges and Barnard Atkins, gents, at the Three Tuns Inn in Bath, Somerset, on 27 March 1638. It was ordered that sentence be heard on 6 November 1638, but no further proceedings survive.\n14/1cc, Defence interrogatories\n1.

What was the occasion or provocation for the words?\n5. Had the witness received or been promised anything from Claxton to testify? If so what and from whom?\n6. Were he and his fellow witnesses present at the time of the 'pretended speaking of the words'? What were the names of those present?\n7.

Asks Davyes and Monke whether the plaintiff's witness Thomas Price was a 'capital enemy' to King who within the last year had wounded King in the side 'with a pikestaff or some other weapon'?

'That before such time as the words are pretended to be spoken by William to Hugh, Hugh would have borrowed some money of William, which William offered to lend Hugh, for as Hugh would give William security for the same. Whereupon, and because William demanded security of Hugh, Hugh grew into a choler, and immediately called William base drunken rogue, and gave William a blow on the face; and the premises were so done before William spoke any of the pretended words against Hugh.'\n3.

They talked 'in a faire and friendlie waie for neere an howre's space, and then Hugh Claxton and William King arose from the table, and both of them went out into the backside together, where they had not long stayed before they came into the hall againe and weare and continued friends together for ought [Dando] perceived to the contrarie; and he verily believeth they were so, for they talked fairlie and friendlie each to the other, and drank each to the other in a loving and friendlie manner *after their coming in againe*'. Some time after their return Claxton said to King, Shall I have it?, Yes, quoth King (in a modest and civill waie), you shall have fortie shillings if you will give me security for the same, whereupon Hugh Claxton forthwith grew verie cholerick and angrie and called William King base drunken rascall, rogue, and with his fist struck the said King on the face; and shortlie thereupon William King and [he] *with Nicholas Priddie* departed away out of the alehouse and King went homewards'. The witness was with King for all the time he was in the alehouse, and King in 'no manner of waie provoked Mr Claxton to use those termes... or to strike him'. He did not hear King at any time call Claxton 'base, rascall rogue'.\n3. He had known Thomas Price for about 1 or 2 years, who was well known 'to be a capital and deadlie enemie of William King'. Last summer 'by common and credible report', Price came to arrest King on Hugh Claxton's suit, and 'beate and wounded Kinge', which wound in King's side, [he] saw.\n4.

Most experts believe it is an autoimmune condition, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks normal tissues in the body.\nIn the case of MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that normally protects nerve fibers in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. The underlying nerve fibers can also be damaged or destroyed in this attack.\nAs the attack progresses, the myelin sheath becomes inflamed and gradually is destroyed, leaving areas of patchy scar tissue (sclerosis) that disrupt the electrical impulses between the brain and other parts of the body.\nThe term \u201cmultiple sclerosis\u201d refers to the multiple areas of scar tissue \u2014 often called \u201clesions\u201d \u2014 that develop along affected nerve fibers and that are visible in MRI scans. The literal meaning of \u201csclerosis\u201d is \u201cpathological hardening of tissue.\u201d\nThe lesions caused by MS, and the resulting disruption of nerve impulses throughout the body, are what cause most of the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis.\nThe nerve damage that occurs in MS can lead to a broad variety of symptoms. Some common early symptoms include visual problems, difficulties with balance and walking, numbness and tingling, and heat intolerance.\nLess common symptoms include problems speaking or swallowing, itchy skin or altered sensations, and tremor.\nIn making an MS diagnosis, a doctor considers a person\u2019s history of symptoms, along with the results of MRI scans and other medical tests.\nThe cause of MS is unknown \u2014 no one knows what sets off the immune reaction that leads to MS lesions in the first place. But it is thought that some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental causes is necessary to trigger the disease.\nSome researchers suspect the immune attack is triggered by certain kinds of viral infections. Others point to low vitamin D levels as a contributing cause. Cigarette smoking is also known to raise the risk of developing MS. (1)\nBecause there\u2019s no national registry for multiple sclerosis, the true prevalence of MS in the United States is unknown. Most organizations estimate it at 400,000, but new research suggests the number of Americans with MS may be closer to 1 million.\nMost people who are diagnosed with MS have no known risk factors. Approximately 20 percent of people with MS have a family member who has it, but even having an identical twin with MS increases the risk by only 20 to 40 percent. So even though having a family history of MS raises the risk somewhat, MS is not considered a genetic or hereditary disease.\nSome other risk factors for MS include being a woman, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, having an autoimmune condition, smoking, exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus, having multiple concussions during adolescence, and living further away from the equator.\nWhile anyone can develop MS, many of those who have it share the following characteristics:\nAge The majority experience their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40.\nRace Caucasians have long been believed to be more than twice as likely as other races to develop MS. But the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials calls this belief into question.\nGender MS is two to three times more common in women as in men. (2)\nClimate MS is five times more common in temperate climates \u2014 like the northern United States, Canada, and Europe \u2014 than in tropical climates.\nGenes People whose close relatives have MS are more susceptible to developing the disease, but there is no evidence the disease is directly inherited.\nScientists have long described different types of MS, the most common being relapsing-remitting MS, primary-progressive MS, and secondary-progressive MS. But in recent years there\u2019s a growing consensus that these are not distinct types of MS, but rather points along a continuum. At some points, inflammation is the predominant characteristic of the disease, while at others, neurodegeneration \u2014 in which old injuries to the brain and spinal cord worsen \u2014 predominates.\nNonetheless, most people with MS are still diagnosed with a particular type of the disease.\nThis type of MS is characterized by periods of active inflammation in the central nervous system, during which symptoms worsen (and new symptoms may develop), alternating with periods when symptoms are less acute.\nThe times when symptoms worsen are known as relapses, flares, or exacerbations. As a relapse ends, the severity of symptoms diminishes, but a person can be left with new, permanent symptoms.\nThe quiet periods between relapses are called remissions. Remissions may last for months or years before a relapse occurs.\nRRMS is the most common type of MS \u2014 estimates vary, but between 80 and 90 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with this relapsing-remitting course of the disease, and most people with RRMS eventually develop secondary-progressive MS.\nThis type of MS is generally considered a second phase of RRMS, in which there is symptom progression and increased disability. People with SPMS may continue to have relapses, although they may be less frequent than in RRMS.\nMost people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to SPMS, but each person\u2019s experience with it \u2014 whether or not they have relapses and how much progression, or disease worsening, occurs \u2014 will be unique.\nIn PPMS there is no initial relapse that signals the beginning of the disease. Instead, MS symptoms gradually appear over time.\nThose who have PPMS generally do not experience acute exacerbations or have distinct remissions, but they may have temporary plateaus during which symptoms lessen somewhat.\nAbout 10 to 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nA small percentage of people with MS have a benign form of the disease, in which symptoms progress very little over the course of a person's lifetime, after the initial attack.\nThere\u2019s some controversy over how (or whether) to classify people with benign MS, since the progress of the disease can vary over a person\u2019s lifetime, according to the National MS Society.\nA small number of people with MS have malignant MS, which is marked by the rapid formation of lesions in the brain and spine, causing severe symptoms, disability, and possibly death.\nBeyond the direct effects of MS symptoms \u2014 of which there are many and of varying severity \u2014 there can be additional consequences of some symptoms.\nBladder problems are very common in people with MS, affecting at least 8", "ogram such as Malware Bytes, and also a registry cleaner for when its done, CCLeaner will do this nicely, and its also free.\n1. download Malware Bytes (Free). www.malwarebytes.org\n2. download and install CCleaner www.piriform.com/ccleaner\n2.

When the timing of a swallow is off, or the muscles involved in swallowing are weak, foods and liquids may enter the airway instead of the esophagus, where they belong.\nIf the person cannot cough forcefully enough to expel them, the food and liquid can end up in the lungs. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious condition that can require hospitalization.\nSymptoms of aspiration pneumonia may include chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, and coughing up foul-smelling phlegm. You should seek medical help if you experience these symptoms.\nMany MS symptoms, including balance problems, muscle weakness, fatigue, dizziness, blurred vision, and numbness, raise the risk of falling.\nFalls, in turn, raise the risk of serious injuries, such as broken bones and head trauma. Falling can also lead to fear of falling, which typically causes a person to become less active, weaker, and even more prone to falling.\nWhile not all falls can be prevented, many can, through a range of strategies to build leg strength, improve balance, fall-proof your home, and address potential causes of dizziness.\nPeople with MS who spend most of their time sitting or lying down need to be aware of \u2014 and take steps to prevent \u2014 pressure sores. Also known as bedsores or pressure ulcers, pressure sores are areas of damaged skin caused by applying pressure to the area for too long.\nThey tend to develop in areas where the bones are close to the skin, such as the heels, tailbone, shoulder blades, and elbows. A combination of moving more often, using special cushions or mattresses, and checking your skin every day can help to prevent pressure sores or catch them early.\nDepression is common among people who have MS, and not just because it\u2019s stressful to have an unpredictable, progressive disease.\nDepression in MS may be a direct result of the immune system's attack on the protective myelin sheaths that envelop nerve fibers, causing behavioral changes, including depression.\nMultiple sclerosis can also change what is known as the body's neuroendocrine system, which oversees hormone release, including hormones implicated in depression, such as serotonin.\nAdditionally, the medicines used to treat MS, such as interferon beta, can also cause depression.\nAnd sometimes depression develops as a result of the stresses and challenges associated with having MS.\nThe good news: No matter what its underlying cause, depression in people with MS can be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.\nThe effects of MS \u2014 its symptoms and their severity \u2014 vary greatly from person to person. How MS will affect any one person is impossible to predict.\nAlthough MS can sometimes be a debilitating disease, the majority of people who have it don't become severely disabled, according to the National MS Society.\nMany people with MS are able to maintain their mobility with the help of assistive devices, such as canes or crutches, often supplemented with scooters or motorized wheelchairs for long distances. About a third of people with MS completely lose their ability to walk.\nPeople with MS who have the best prognosis are usually those who:\nStudies that have examined causes of death among people with MS have found pulmonary (lung) infections to be a primary cause of excessive death in this population, and one study found that sepsis is a major cause of MS-related deaths. (6,7)\nSepsis is a life-threatening, whole-body inflammation that is triggered by a severe infection. It most commonly occurs in people with a weakened immune system.\nBut with better treatments now available for MS, the gap in life expectancy for people with MS may decrease. There are now several MS medications that can slow the progression of the disease and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses.\nTreating MS involves treating relapses \u2014 acute episodes of inflammation \u2014 usually with high doses of steroids; using disease-modifying therapies to prevent relapses and disease progression; and treating the symptoms of MS using medication, physical therapy, other types of rehabilitative therapies, a healthy lifestyle, complementary treatments, and often counseling for depression or anxiety.\nFor people who have relapsing-remitting MS, a handful of disease-modifying drugs can slow the progression of multiple sclerosis and lower the frequency and severity of acute attacks. For people with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), only one medication, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), has been shown to reduce the likelihood of disability progression.\nMS is not a rare disease, but it\u2019s not that common, either. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that many people know very little about it, and that sometimes what they know is wrong. In addition, scientists\u2019 understanding of MS \u2014 what raises the risk of getting it, how best to treat it, and how to live well with it \u2014 has advanced considerably in recent years. So even some doctors may hold outdated beliefs about MS.

Certain foods may also help manage symptoms associated with MS, such as high-fiber foods helping to relieve constipation.\nWhen you have MS, connecting with others who have it can be therapeutic.

These parasites bite and drink blood from both human and animal hosts, sometimes transmitting deadly bacteria that can lead to devastating illnesses.\nWhile there are several flea-repellent methods and remedies you can use to help control fleas and protect your family and pets, it can be tricky to get rid of fleas entirely from around your property.\nBecause fleas are so common, and because they may be more common in some regions than others, it\u2019s important to have a good game plan for flea protection and control. This is especially true when it comes to protecting your pets.\nBoth dogs and cats can be victims of flea bites, especially if they are unprotected with flea medications or flea collars. However, cats tend to be most at risk for flea infestations and flea bites, especially outdoor cats who spend the majority of their time in areas where wild animals may roam and transmit fleas.\nIn today\u2019s article, we are going to talk about the best cat flea shampoo to help protect your cat. But before we begin, let\u2019s first take a moment to talk about fleas.\nLet\u2019s get started!\nBut First, Let\u2019s Talk About Fleas\nUnprotected cats are commonly prone to suffering from fleas and flea bites.\nFleas are small, parasitic insects that live in grassy areas like woodlands, fields, and backyards. They have no wings and thus they cannot fly, but these pests can jump. In fact, fleas can jump up to 200 times their body size, which is about 13 inches.\nFleas also contain small barbs on their legs that help them cling to hosts, and they survive on blood hosts that include mammals like humans, wild animals, and pets like cats and dogs.\nThere are over 2,000 different species of fleas across the world, and they are problematic in nearly every continent except for Antarctica.\nThough not all fleas are deadly, some can be. In the United States, fleas are known to carry some serious diseases that they can spread to both people and pets.\nThe most common flea in the United States is known as the \u201ccat flea\u201d, or the Ctenocephalides felis. The cat flea, in spite of its name, can be problematic for a variety of animals and sometimes even people.\nBut where do fleas come from?\nMost cats will pick up fleas while outdoors, but outdoor cats are not the only cats at risk for fleas and fleabites. Even indoor cats can be at risk for fleas, especially if other pets bring fleas indoors, or if you bring our cat outdoors to play in the yard or go on a walk. It takes only a moment to pick up a flea, and a single pregnant flea can lead to an entire infestation on your cat or inside your home.\nFleas often find their way into your yard or property after being brought there by wild animals. Wild animal hosts for fleas include a number of animals like raccoons, deer, rabbits, mice, squirrels, rats, and more.\nThis means that even if you are vigilant and take care to keep your yard flea-free, you can never be certain that fleas are not on your property from one moment to the next.\nIf a cat picks up fleas, they could potentially bring them into your home and transmit them to other pets in the house and even to you or your loved ones.\nThough fleas are incredibly small, they can have a big impact on the health of our furry family members and even on us.\nKeep reading more to learn about the dangers of fleas to people and pets.\nThe Dangers Of Fleas For Cats, Dogs, And Even People\nUnprotected cats can transmit fleas to people and other pets in the home.\nAs we just mentioned, fleas are a serious problem in not only the United States but also the world. Not only are fleas serious pests, but they are also quite dangerous. Fleas can carry and transmit a number of deadly diseases to both people and pets, including diseases like Murine Typhus, Tularemia, Bubonic Plague, and Tungiasis.\nOf these diseases, the most common disease transmitted by fleas to cats in the United States is Murine Typhus.\nMurine Typhus is caused due to Rickettsia typhi, a bacteria that is carried by infected wild animals, and even feral cats. Wild animals that can carry Rickettsia typhi tend to include animals like rats, opossums, raccoons, and other common wild animals that live in both suburban and urban areas.\nCat typhus, also known as feline panleukopenia, has a wide variety of symptoms that can range from mild to severe. Symptoms can take up to seven days to present themselves in your cat, and they include nausea, diarrhea, shivering, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and loss of appetite.\nTyphus can be deadly in cats, but it is also treatable if you recognize the symptoms quickly. Most importantly, typhus is preventable when you utilize the tools and medications provided by your veterinarian, as well as other forms of pest control to repel and manage fleas in the area.\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s time to talk about cat flea shampoo.\nWhat Is Cat Flea Shampoo And Does It Really Work?\nCat shampoos can work to prevent and protect your cat from fleas when used properly.\nCat flea shampoo can be somewhat controversial, depending on who you speak with. While many people rave about cat flea shampoo products, not everyone agrees that cat flea shampoos are the best forms of flea prevention or protection for cats.\nWith that being said, there are some cat flea shampoo products that have proven effective against fleas and ticks, and some shampoos can even provide a longer-lasting solution to flea prevention than typical pet shampoos.\nCat flea shampoo products work most often by utilizing chemical ingredients designed to kill fleas and ticks on contact. Many of these types of cat flea shampoo products can take up to 48 hours to work, but they are often made to kill fleas, eggs, and nymphs, as well as other pests like lice.\nSome cat flea shampoo products work only to kill fleas on contact once your cat has already contracted fleas. Other cat flea shampoo products can help to protect your cat from fleas for up to 28 days after application.\nWe should note here that most cat flea shampoo products contain chemical ingredients like insecticides, which can have adverse side effects on your cat. If you\u2019re concerned about using a cat flea shampoo that contains insecticide chemicals, you can try using natural cat flea shampoo products that work using special oils and other natural, plant-based ingredients.\nHowever, some natural cat flea shampoo products may not be as effective as chemical cat flea shampoo products, and it\u2019s important to do your research before deciding which option is best for you and your cat.\nFurthermore, sensitive cats can still have an adverse reaction to natural products as well. If you\u2019re not sure about the best type of flea prevention and protection for your cat, it\u2019s best to speak with a trusted veterinarian.\nHowever, if you have decided that cat flea shampoo is the best option for you and your furry friend, we have listed several of our top-rated products below.\nTake a look.\nThe Best Cat Flea Shampoo, According To Experts\nIt should be noted that not all cat shampoos for fleas are safe for kittens under the age of 12 weeks.\nRemember, not all cat flea shampoo products are designed to work equally. Furthermore, many cat flea shampoo products work using chemical ingredients.\nWhen you are looking for a cat flea shampoo for your unique pet, be sure to read the ingredients and consider the unique sensitivities of your cat.\nAlso, be aware that not all cat flea shampoo products work to provide long-term protection from fleas and ticks. When deciding which product you want to use to protect your pet, it\u2019s important to consider your cat\u2019s lifestyle, how often your cat is outside, and whether or not your cat is sensitive to certain ingredients.\nLast, be sure to speak with your veterinarian about other forms of flea and tick protection and control, especially if you live in a region that is known for its prevalence of fleas and ticks.\nNow, without further ado, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best cat flea s", "mH\nCapacity: 4.5L to 5L\nTemperature: +70 degC to +180degC\nPower: 220-240V/2,300 Watts (3-Pin Plug)\nWire Mesh Basket x 1, Oil Tank Cover x 1, SS Base Grate x 1\n1.
