Whether an organization is setting up an offshore location or developing something new in-house, following the ITIL framework along with a robust project management structure will do wonders for the business.\nAccording to AXELOS, PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) is a flexible method that guides organizations through the essentials for running a successful project regardless of project type or scale. PRINCE2 can be tailored to meet your organization or industry specific requirement.\nITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a widely-accepted IT service management approach in organizations across the globe. The ITIL framework is drawn from best practices followed by both public and private sectors all over the world. The best practices in ITIL are based on expert advice and inputs from ITIL users, and combine the latest thinking with sound, common sense guidance. ITIL has, hence, gained in importance as a methodology that delivers positive business outcomes for enterprises.\nThe ITIL framework addresses many of the limitations of IT by providing a service-oriented framework which meets the business needs of the customer. But, for the ITIL framework to be implemented, which is a project in itself, a rigorous project management methodology in PRINCE2 must be implemented as well to ensure a greater degree of success. PRINCE2 and ITIL combination complement each other in several ways:\nThe best benefit that PRINCE2 brings to the table is the principle of continued business justification and consistent focus on the business case throughout the project. This ensures the project does not change course from its main objective at any point of time.\nBreaking large chunks of work to sizeable chunks will help in handling a project more efficiently. Each requirement will be analyzed and signed off from the right stakeholders. With PRINCE2 methodology, it gives one an honest view of what can be done and when it can be done.\nBecause ITIL demands changing not only the IT department, but also the rest of the organization, ITIL implementations require an impeccable project management structure. Anything less and the implementation is at severe risk. With its careful risk management processes described in t", "file and organized in folders.

However, in February 2008, FFF and the entire influenza community accomplished a monumental achievement when the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) expanded its influenza vaccination recommendations to include all children ages six months to 18 years.

Croatian purists would argue it is not a traditional music of the region as the style of singing and instruments are largely imported from Italy (by local Italian Croatians) and Spain (by sailors) \u2026hence its popularity along the Coast. They would argue that traditional music revolves around the kolo and lindjo (dances) an instruments like Dangubica, Diplica, Istarski Mih, Jedinka, Lijerica, Tamburica Gaida, Gusle, Samica, \u0160argija, Sopila, Curla, Diple (which is similar to the Hungarian Duda) and styles of singing like the ganga, becarac etc. I assume the purists are right but that doesn\u2019t denigrate the klapa which is specifically Croatian also. I have some non-klapa traditional records in my collection for those interested \u2026and some waiting for listening \u2026 be warned though \u2026 that music can be dissonant and played in weird scales.\nSo, klapa is their \"commercial\" folk music. Though, as I have said, the lyrics arise from traditional themes and concerns.\nAnother warning, later commercial klapa music, especially from the 70s and 80s, borders on cabaret as they added a lot of instrumentation, strings etc, whilst the 90s and present stuff has a lot of pop in it. There are also crossovers with English language pop. The pure \"folk\" form exists in abundance though and should be acapella, or accompanied with only one instrument.\nI'm keeping this obviously.\nattached (lyrics above):\nBarka Je Malena\nNa Brigu Kuca Mala\nSorry, I can\u2019t find any clips of Ansambl Dalmacija\nan ad for a klapa compilation LP which include Ansambl Dalmacija:\nhere are some other klapa groups \u2013 ranging from the traditional to the cabaret:\nFor those interested in other Croat music styles:\n(originally posted: 20/09/2009)", "What themes are explored in the post-apocalyptic kingdoms described in the text", "What observation did James Thurber make about the nature of wit in relation to humor and satire", "What materials are suitable for creating a worm farm", "What are the characteristics of the landscapes created by the French photographer and digital artist in his surrealist photomontages", "Overheard on Episode 5:\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s hope for a government shutdown so we can be topically relevant\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe Peugot is the epitome of French vehicular majesty.\u201d\n\u201cBarack Obama is actually his superhero identity.\u201d\nAnd then Faiqa uses", "monologist from all other Warlocks. It's powerful, it grants us amazing abilities, and it of course makes one look like one of the greatest villains of all time. Yet, despite it's obvious greatness, many Warlocks criticize Metamorphosis for being simply a cosmetic change, only really increasing damage done, because the abilities granted to a Metamorphosed Warlock are all but worthless. A taunt, a melee attack, a charge and an immolation aura really are only useful for a tank in melee combat, exactly what a Warlock doesn't want to find himself in. So this ability needs to change what it gives, but more over affect the abilities a Warlock already uses. Recently, Tree of Life was changed to work like Metamorphosis, but instead of adding more abilities it changed the ones they currently use. This approach should be taken to Metamorphosis, perhaps going so far as to make the entire rotation change. I'd like to see some significant changes; Curroptions that work more like instant blasts of shadow magic, dealing the same damage but in a much smaller time, Shadowbolts that fire three in one shot, to hit multiple or the same target, Immolates that burst and make new Immolate ticks, Soul Fires becoming spammable, and so forth. I would love that Metamorphosis isn't just a visual or damage dealing change, but a complete and total change to the Warlock, that Metamorphosis should be an amazing thing to use.\n4. Affliction. Early in my raiding career, I switched to Affliction because Demonology was simply not a raiding spec. I did both Naxxramas and Ulduar as an Affliction Warlock, and I must admit it is a very fun spec. It's the oldest viable DPS spec for Warlocks, back when Demonology was only for leveling and Destruction was for the odd Warlock who wanted to be like a Mage and endlessly fire Shadowbolt. Ironic, as now Affliction's worst criticism is that it is the new Shadowbolt spammer. Yet, it is still a very solid spec, keeping four DoTs, Haunt, Unstable Affliction, Curroption and Curse of Agony, up at any one time, filling in the duration of those with Shadowbolt volleys. Long ago, the pet of choice was ambiguous for Affliction Warlocks, where some would say the optimal Demon was, in fact, the Doomguard. Now, an Affliction Warlock has his lovable and loyal Felhunter at his side. With the inclusion Soul Swap, nearly all the broken aspects of Affliction are rested. I think the only means of improvement for Affliction really are to add new procs, ways to keep an Affliction Warlock from becoming too locked into a routine. The only real such thing Affliction has is Nightfall, a small chance from a Curroption tick to have an instant cast Shadowbolt, and it both procs far too little to make any meaningful impact on Affliction's rotation, and only makes what you were doing anyway an instant cast. Almost every Nightfall proc I received while playing Affliction was instantly used because I was in the middle of casting Shadowbolt anyway.\nA few new interesting talents could really make Affliction a fun yet stable spec to play as a Warlock. I can't help but look at the new Shadow Priest talents for inspiration, as the two are nearly identical; setting up DoTs then filling in the time between them with a powerful Shadow attack. Currently, Shadow Priests have some pretty interesting talents, particularly Shadowy Apparition, which randomly will make a ghost of yourself to attack an enemy. Affliction could make some great use out of abilities like this, or perhaps even non-DPS abilities, like the Shadow Priest's Dispersion, which can add some utility without necessarily increasing damage. All in all, Affliction simply needs some stirring up, a few abilities to add some interesting mechanics, and Affliction will be nigh perfect.\n5. Destruction. Between the time I switched from Demonology, and settled on Affliction for raiding, I went with the standard Warlock spec: Destruction. Unfortunately, what I found was not pleasing. I found a spec that played more like a castrated Mage than any Warlock. I would dare to guess that 2/3 of all my casts were Incineration. The rotation is astoundingly simple; Start with Immolate, then with the Glyph of Conflagrate, instantly cast Conflagrate, which won't consume the Immolate, then gain the Backdraft effect, making your first Chaos Bolt quickly, along with two quick Incinerates, then...you simply keep casting Incinerates until Immolate is nearly gone, then Conflagrate, backdrafting everything over again. No cooldowns, no random procs, no real strategy. My favorite looking ability, Chaos Bolt, is relegated to just a green Incinerate. It's such a shame. I think what is required to make Destruction simply a decent spec is to give Destruction some depth, a way to keep a Destruction Warlock having to know what is going on, to separate a skillful player from one who simply pushes the buttons. I can't help but feel that Searing Pain could have a place in a new Destruction, an ability to fit between Chaos Bolt and Incinerate. Perhaps there could be a way to give Searing Pain a value above Incinerate, maybe even have Searing Pain have a high Critical Strike damage, so any proc dealing with Critical Strike would favor Searing Pain as opposed to just continuing to cast Incinerate. I also need to express my disappointment with Glyph of Conflagrate, a Glyph that makes so much difference, yet none at all. On the one hand, it makes it so that Conflagrate doesn't consume the DoT of Immolate, so you can use it both before and after casting Immolate. It essentially makes Conflagrate into a fancy Fireblast. Yet, while this is a significant change, in practicality, it is almost no difference. The cooldown of Conflagrate is the same as the duration of Immolate, meaning that the fact that it can be cast both before and after casting Immolate, this only affects your rotation once. Essentially, with the glyph, you get one free Conflagrate at the beginning of a rotation. Then, you'd only be able to Conflagrate at the end of each Immolate rotation, which is how the original spell was designed. The original spell was designed to, I believe, add a level of skill to when a Warlock should cast it, waiting till the very last second of Immolate's DoT. Many Warlocks now ask for the Glyph to be baseline for the Conflagrate spell, but I think it should be the opposite; the Glyph should simply go away completely. Conflagrate should be used skillfully, watching the last bit of Immolate, thinking about how many more Incinerates you can cast before you Conflagrate. I think with those two major changes, Destruction will change from the beginner's easy spec to a decent spec that can be used skillfully.\nThat's it. My thoughts and feelings, my hopes and dreams for my favorite class in the game. I hope my thoughts at least coincide with those of the developers, and the things I hope to see will come to pass. I do hope it was at least something interesting for you, the reader, to read, despite how long it may of been.\nUntil next the stars align, and the portals can be opened", "Trained in Management and an early member of the British Institute of Management and the Institute of Directors, John has worked with psychometric profiles for over fifteen years and completed thousands of individual profiles.\nWith a background in IT, John has also developed a unique software application that allows management and staff to contribute positively in the solution of challenges that affect almost any part of the business.\nPositivity is at the core of everything that John develops.

All because of the abrupt Google\u2019s updates!\nPanda, Penguin, and Pigeon were all there to give businesses a hard time.\nBelieve me; search engines never care how passionate you are and how much money you have put on the stake.\nThey only care about \u2013 well, themselves \u2013 just like any other business.\nRemember that when you are facing search engines \u2013 say Google, luck is the last thing you can rely on.\nOnly one Google update can end your game!\nHere is a timeline of Google\u2019s core updates that shaped the \u2018modern SEO era\u2019.\nLiving in the complex world of Google, fighting with its bots, and dealing with its algorithm changes mean that you always have to find a safe end for your survival.\nWe found that in the form of guest posting services.\nAnd that\u2019s from where our story of writing the success story of 1000+ agencies began!\nBut before I break down our story, if you don\u2019t know how guest posting strategy is a savior for your link building antics, here is some insight into this knight in shining armor for your business:\nPanacea for Inbound Marketing Strategies\nWhat do businesses want?\n- Top search ranking\u2026\n- More leads\u2026\n- Enhance traffic\u2026\n- Higher Conversion rate\u2026\n- Establish brand credibility\u2026\n- Build brand awareness\u2026\nAnd what if I say that guest blogging can do all this for you?\nYes, strange, but true.\nIncorporating guest posting tactics in your SEO strategy can single-handedly help you establish brand authority, get convertible leads, relevant links, more traffic, increase sales, and so much more.\nAnd this claim isn\u2019t short of any proof.\nMany digital marketers swear by the effectiveness of guest blogs in making them who they are today.\nNeil Patel, called as one of the top 10 marketers by Forbes, calls guest blogging strategy as his most treasured tool, and the force behind making QuickSprout, his personal blog, as successful as it is today.\nThings also worked the right way for Danny Iny, the founder of Mirasee, when he switched to writing blogs for guest posting to increase his traffic.\nIt not only helped him increase traffic but also built his email list.\nSource: Mirasee Blog\nWell, his first blog was on an authority blog, Copyblogger. But not everyone gets the opportunity to land its very first blog on a big platform.\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that you should give up on guest blogging SEO ideas if you don\u2019t initially hit big.\nBut Danny Iny\u2019s example surely gives a big hint: you need to do guest blogging the right way to get the right results.\nNothing less, nothing more!\nNot all guest posts work the same way because guest posting in SEO is not only about creating content, publishing it on a blog, and getting a backlink.\nIt is way more than this.\nYou have to be on point to yield the desired results. That\u2019s where many brands take a dip: they don\u2019t know the right trick to incorporate guest posting antics in their inbound marketing strategies.\nBefore digging deeper into the significance of guest post articles, here is what doing guest blogging \u2018the right way\u2019 means:\nUnfolding the secrets behind result-driven guest posting\u2026\nCreating the best guest blog should be centered on:\n- High-quality content that provides values\n- Authority sites to get authority links\n- No manipulation of links\nThese are the basic rules governing the world of guest blogging services, but all these rules have a world of their own.\nYou have to focus on each one of them to make things fall in the bracket for you.\nContent is King, Treat it the Right Way\nI can\u2019t emphasize enough on the significance of the content in a guest article. Let me rephrase it: the significance of high-quality content.\nGoogle is in a weird obsession with high-quality content, to be honest. If you want things to work out for you, you also have to be obsessed with it.\nAnd it also pays back in the form of success.\nHigh-quality content doesn\u2019t mean that only your language and grammar should be on point. It also means that\u2026\n- Your topic should be well-researched\n- Content should be exciting and engaging\n- You provide value to readers\nLet me admit that it is not easy to pull all these factors in one post, but you have to if you want things to work out.\nBecause according to Andrey Lipattsev, Google\u2019s Search Quality Senior Strategist, high-quality content, and inbound links reign as the top two signals for Google algorithms.\nSo, you just can\u2019t expect to land somewhere safe if you simply jump over the \u2018high-quality content\u2019 factor.\nThe good thing is that marketers are slowly but finally understanding the significance of creating engaging content. 72% of marketers give priority to creating more engaging content.\nDigital marketers call the content king of the SEO world. You have to treat this king the right way because it genuinely reigns inbound marketing strategies.\nBesides creating engaging content, providing value to users is another factor that is hard to miss.\nYour reader has so much to do and so many options that he just can\u2019t stick to your post if you are telling him what he already knows.\nAccording to Ann Handley, MarketingProfs\u2019 chief content officer,\n\u201c\u2026many of us vastly undervalue writing in the content process, which is why we have a tough time creating \u2018engaging content\u2019.\u201d\nOne of the reasons why marketers find it hard to create an engaging and valuable blog is because they create content to get links, not for providing value.\nThat\u2019s where things start going out of the window.\nFlip your blog creation goal the other way around, and you will see drastic changes in your content \u2013 a positive one.\nAuthority Links Spice Up Your Link Profile:\nWe have already talked about the significance of inbound links for Google\u2019s algorithm.\nYou can see that the backlink factor plays a huge role in pacifying Google in your favor.\nBut while talking about backlinks, don\u2019t forget to read the word \u2018authority\u2019 along!\nSearch engines don\u2019t fall for every backlink; only authority backlinks play their part in establishing a strong backlink profile.\nJust ask yourself:\nWhat if you want to get some advice regarding your health: would you go to a doctor or a random person passing on the road? Doctor \u2013 right?\nWhy? Because you know he is the right and authentic person to get a consultation regarding health issues.\nThe same goes for the link building!\nGoogle doesn\u2019t weigh all backlinks equally.\nIt gives more importance to a link coming from a high authority site, let\u2019s say the Wall Street Journal, rather than a newly created or", "What are the dimensions and specifications of the iOS applications developer business card", "What are the varying terrain features of The Bowl at Big Sky ski area", "When was HQTelecom.com accredited by the Better Business Bureau", "what Frank is listening to #90 \u2013 ANSAMBL DALMACIJA \u2013 Falile Se Kastelanke \u2013 (Yugoton) \u2013 1965\nOf course I know Ansambl Dalmacija.\nMy mum has some of their records which she got when we went back to Croatia, in the then Yugoslavia, on holidays in 1973.\nI subsequently grew up listening to their evocative songs.\nThe first album of theirs I personally bought was in the US in 1994. I was in an op shop in Astoria, New York and found a release of theirs on the legendary \"Monitor\" label. \"Monitor\" were an \"ethnic\" label from the US that released music from all nations of the world for the many migrants to the US.\nThis 10\u201d album I bought last year from a 40 something Croatian guy in the US \u2013 from San Pedro stereotypically, as San Pedro has a very large Croatian population. He is a nice guy, a musician in Croatian-American traditional bands and a Liberace impersonator. In any event I bought this and some other albums and a lot of 45s of various Croat artists.\nI didn't really need this album as I have all of the songs but this is the original 10\" from sometime in the 1960s (probably 1965). So, it\u2019s an indulgence.\nI already knew and loved the songs. As I'm sitting here with a glass of wine listening to this I'm transported back to a Croatia in my minds eye. If I had not been there the music would have been the wallpaper in my mind for that country. That and the stories my relatives weaned me on \u2026 stories dating back to the 1950s when they all left. It would be easy and cynical to say times have changed, and they have, but the traditional (see below) music of the Croatian coast is still very popular, even with the younger crowd. What struck me whilst I was there recently was the fact that all the kids might be into the Ramones, Nirvana, Eric Clapton (groan), Pink Floyd (double groan) and Croatian variations of the same but they also all actively know the songs of their parents and their grandparents. This is their folk music \u2026 at least along the coast. And it is very popular \u2026 there are hundreds of professional groups and many klapa (see below) festivals.\nLike all folk music this may be sung professionally but it is also the music of the people. So, when the wine is flowing and the night is late, a piano accordion or guitar (or mandolin) is pulled out and a sing along will ensue until all the wine (or smokes) are finished. Like all good folk music no one is excluded \u2026 8 to 80, male and female, sober and drunk.\nSimilarly, like all good folk music there is message in the music. It would have been punishable by jail to sing overtly patriotic or nationalistic songs (seriously \u2013 even up to the 1980s \u2013 I had cousins who went to jail for saying the wrong things when pissed) in communist Yugoslavia. Ethnic songs though about your home and life were allowed and in my view are for more effective as songs and as propaganda, as they preserve a world view and a culture, which is what patriotic songs try to do in a less subtle fashion anyway.\nThese songs are in the (festival) klapa tradition which is a style of music from coastal Croatia most commonly associated with Dalmatia though it is practiced up into the northern region of Primorija. In old Yugoslavia the music was popular throughout the country though. It was popularised in the 1940s-1960s though the musical tradition goes back centuries. By that I mean that there are old traditional songs done in the klapa style (see below).\nFrom the net: Dalmatia has a rich and long musical tradition. The music is typically Mediterranean one and often strongly resembles seaside Italian, Spanish or Portuguese music in the temperament and structure. What distinguishes it from the latter, are the solely vocally sung (a capella) songs by male five-to-eight ensemble \u2013 \"klapa\" \u2013 so called \"klapa\" songs\u2026.So called Dalmatian \"klapa\" songs are at the core of this music. \"Klapa\" in Dalmatian dialect means company or group, while in musical terms it refers to five-to-eight member ensembles. Traditionally, the ensemble consists only of male voices, but nowadays we witness the emergence of many mixed and female ensembles with a varying number of members\u2026Nevertheless, its basic characteristic and distinction are, and remain, solely vocal harmony-singing, only rarely discreetly and quietly accompanied by instruments. Part-singing, usually in four parts, is originally spontaneous, performed by the ear and not by following note recordings, so harmonization is simple. A low-pitched accompaniment is stressed by a larger number of singers, giving the songs a more intimate atmosphere.\nI specified the \"festival\" klapa tradition above. \"Festival klapa\" adds instumentation to the music whereas traditional klapa is exclusively a capella.\nThe songs are not diverse when it comes to subject matter \u2013 drinking wine, eating, playing a card game called briscula, falling in love, leaving your love, family, leaving your loving family, the harshness of the land, going to sea, and leaving your homeland (usually in the middle of the night). The \"genre\" has many very melancholy (if not incredibly sad) ballads as well as a lot of up-tempo songs. The slower songs are usually hyper emotional and the upbeat songs are over-exuberant, though even in the up-beat songs there seems to me to be a underlying melancholia. After all, we are talking about a country of (now) 4.5 million people where over a 50 year period about 2 million people left. I say \"left\" because only a few migrated. Most of them escaped as migration was not allowed between 1945 and 1965 which was the period of the biggest exodus. And yes, it does not escape me that there are many similarities with the Irish in history and music. Though unlike the Irish they have the additional \"tie\" of a single language, and not the difficulty of having a second dominant language (English, derrr).\nAn American Croatian musical klapa group described the music in its historical site as such: \u201cEven so, the Klapa tradition has been developing for hundreds of years. Originally, groups of men would join together in their villages and sing folk songs based on love, fishing, and the sea.

Everything from scope, success and different criteria, are clearly identified and approved by senior management. This saves a lot of time in starting up a project.\nThe ITIL framework helps PRINCE2 to focus on the bigger picture. It is extremely important to balance both cost and quality in ITIL which helps in taking correct decisions for quality improvement which adheres towards the bigger picture. The emphasis on quality also fits in with the PRINCE2 framework, where the quality theme elaborates on aspects such as Project Product Description, Product Description, Quality Register, Quality Management Strategy, among others.\nThe ITIL framework implementation helps in \u2018benefit realization\u2019 which happens only after the project is completed. PRINCE2 has no part in this, as the project management structure mandates the completion of the project successfully. But, the ITIL framework helps to realize the benefits when the implementation is done and it can fine tune it when there is change after the project is completed.\nManaging various constraints such as time, price and the scope of business are all superimposed on a framework of meeting quality requirements, and this forms the foundation of project management. Meeting customer-defined needs, availability, reliability, capability and cost-effectiveness of business services offered along with improving responsiveness in managing change form the basis of ITIL.

Paladins now have Holy Power, Shaman can duel wield at level 10, Priests can make shadowy apparitions of themselves, Hunters have focus, and so on. Pity I'm not part of it. Yet, I see Warlock lagging far behind. There has been very little change to the Warlock trees, and the Soul Shard system in particular seems to be in a ludicrously low level of development. There are only six uses for Soul Shards right now, and gathering them is just as much a hassle as it is today. I believe there are still many changes to come, but in this early stage of development, I've decided to post my wish list for the Cataclysm Warlock.\n1. Soul Shards. I hope so deeply that this mechanic comes from the muck of development as a shining and brilliant mechanic, the envy of Spellcasters everywhere. As of right now, the theory is that Soul Shards should be used as a resource, consumed by the spell Soulburn, to alter spells. Yet, right now, the only spells that are affected are the summon Demon spells, making them instant cast, Drain Life, which reduces casting speed on its target, Teleporting to the Demonic Circle, which increases your movement speed once you've teleported, making Soul fire an instant cast and Searing Pain guaranteed to be a critical strike. Very minor changes. The issue right now really is how to balance situational use with rotational use. Some Warlocks hold that anything less than a damage increase makes this new mechanic pointless. I, in fact, believe the opposite. Right now the theory goes that a Warlock should \"Consume 3 Soul Shards\" every boss encounter, while I think the philosophy should instead be that a Warlock, in a pure DPS fight or a, pardon the crude vernacular, \"Tank-and-spank\" boss, should not have to use any Soul Shards. It should be a mechanic used when under pressure, when rotations break down and a Warlock needs to make a snap choice what to do. Yes, a Warlock won't use their Soul Shards every fight, but when they do it should be a rather impressive show of skill and ability to use it right.\nMoreover, I'm personally bothered by the current way to regain Soul Shards, which is to either use Drain Soul when a creature is about to die, or Soul Harvest to regain life and Soul Shards. Both feel very clumsy, and were the hallmarks of the problems of the old Soul Shard system. A crucial part of a class's resource system shouldn't be replenished by spells, it should be an innate mechanic that regenerates on its own. I believe the current issue on this revolves around the fear that Warlocks will simply break combat to regenerate Soul Shards, then return to battle with a fresh set of abilities, and while having to manually gain Soul Shards helps this problem, I still think it needs much more polish and design change, so that it will be an automatic process.\n2. Curses. Warlocks have always had a difficult decision to make, both in PVE and PVP, over whether to use a utility Curse or a damaging Curse. In PVE, there is always arguments about which Warlock has \"Curse of the Elements Duty.\" With the introduction of the \"Bane\" magical effect, now Curses can now be entirely in the realm of utility. Now, however, Curses are amazingly narrow. There is only Curse of Weakness, Curse of Tongues, and Curse of the Elements. I think Curses need a larger range of choices and abilities, rather than simply using Curse of the Elements for it's DPS increase. The biggest one that comes to mind is Curse of Exhaustion. It is such a useful Curse, I think it deserves to be made baseline. Though I think two or so more curses could be added, though all I can think of are the rather interesting curses used in Molten Core.\n3. Demonology. Demonology is currently my Warlock's preferred Spec, both for PVE and PVP, and it was the spec I leveled in. It's a very familiar and fun spec for me, and I'm sure I'll continue to use the old Felguard in Cataclysm. I do think there's some significant room to expand, though. The first is the Hand of Gul'dan ability, which seems like a decent ability, but it seems to dominate so much of the currently sparse Demonology tree. It may seem a strange thing to get upset by, but it does. Moreover, currently the level 10 ability granted by becoming a Demonologist is the ability to summon a Felguard, his old place in the talent tree taken up by the talent Inferno, letting a Demonologist cast Hellfire while moving. I don't think any simple level 10 Warlock is capable of handling the great powers of the Felguard, nor should he be allowed such a privilege. A Warlock should be able to experience the joys of earning and using multiple Demons. At the very least, the old Blueberry, the Void walker, should be the leveling pet for a decent time. Again, this may seem odd to be upset at, but I am.\nBesides these, though, the Demonology tree looks strong and healthy. Molten Core keeps a Warlock switching between casting Shadowbolt and Incinerate, but now quick Incinerate blasts are more valuable because of Impending Doom, which reduces the cooldown on Metamorphosis. Demonic Pact still keeps our Spellpower high, and with the, hopeful, addition of Demon Bolt into our rotation, Demonology will be a powerful yet skillful Warlock to play. Yet, I think two abilities still need considerable tweaking.\nThe first is Demonic Empowerment, which is a crucial ability, really is just a button to push on cooldown with no real visible effect. Its biggest issue is that while it has an effect for each Demon, the only Warlock able to get this ability is a Demonologist, and he will only use a Felguard. Its effect for the Felguard is to simply make him big, red and scary, and increases attack speed, and makes him immune to crowd control. It is essentially a copy of the Beast Master's Bestial Wrath, but at least the Hunter's version improves their own attack power as well. Although Demonic Empowerment works, it touches me as too boring. This isn't a critically broken spell, but it could stand to be improved somehow.\nThe other issue, however, I think does require more consideration, and that is the Felguard himself. He is currently one of the most boring and simplistic pets in the entire game. He can simply charge, taunt, cleave, and build up a passive attack power bonus. While I love the big lug, he doesn't do anything but smash an enemy. With the improvements made to all the other minions, giving the Voidwalker a specific taunt and a damaging ability, the Succubus a push back effect, and the Imp a new DoT, the Felguard deserves to have at least have a full set of abilities he may use. Perhaps he could be kept within the Warrior theme, allow him to give a debuff of some kind, like a Hamstring or Disarm ability, or perhaps make Demonic Frenzy more powerful, but at the cost of it being a cooldown the Warlock has to initiate.\nThe last part of Demonology that certainly needs alot of attention and change is Metamorphosis.
