While the Tide's streak has reached 35 straight games (the last being Ole Miss' BenJarvus Green-Ellis, 131 yards in 2007), Penn State's is up to 17.\n\"They're a hard-nosed team,\" said Richardson, who became an even bigger target Tuesday when Sports Illustrated put him on this week's cover after his first career start. \"They like getting in a dog fight, they love to come at you. They're going to challenge us, so we need to challenge ourselves in practice every day and be ready for (them).\n\"That's when you're big time players show. We're going to go toe-to-toe with these boys and see who the bigger man comes out.\"\nBut there are two uncharacteristic things about this particular Penn State team, or more specifically young spots. Attracting the most attention last week was Rob Bolden at quarterback and completing 20 of 29 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns, the best passing performance by a Nittany Lion true freshman starter in program history (although it's a very short list).\n\"I was skinny, the game was moving 100 miles an hour, but I don't think I was as highly-touted coming out of high school,\" said senior quarterback Greg McElroy about himself as a freshman. \"It's not a sprint, it's a marathon for me. It worked out.\"\nThe other is at linebacker, the traditional strength of the Penn State defense where there's three new starters in senior Chris Colasanti, junior Nate Stupar and senior Bani Gbadyu, playing between a physical defensive line and veteran secondary.\n\"They do a really good job,\" McElroy said. \"They're really well-coached. They do a good job tackling. They're obviously known for their athletic and really talented linebackers. They have some of those. They do a really good job with their coverages. It's not the most difficult defense I've even seen, but they're so sound. I really do a very good job of being in the right place at the right time. It's kind of fun to watch.\"\nIt should be for fans on Saturday evening in an old-school type matchup that Jordan believes will be won by the more physical team. Consequently that Fluker-Carpenter tidal wave-type formation might be seen again, both in and out of the wildcat as the Tide hopes to maximize its playmakers.\n\"Any way they can get me the ball, I'll take it,\" Julio Jones said.", "I'll be there!\nThis would be a cool day to see them.

Numerous technologies implemented on Galaxy-class starships were tested aboard earlier prototype vessels, including the Oberth-class USS Pegasus in the 2350s.\nThe warp core was designed at Outpost Seran-T-one on stardate 40052 by some of the most brilliant engineering minds in the Federation, including Leah Brahms of the Theoretical Propulsion Group. Major component construction of Galaxy-class ships was carried out both in orbit and at ground based facilities.\nUpon its launch, the Galaxy-class had become the most technologically sophisticated and complicated ship ever built by the Federation.\nService aboard a Galaxy-class starship was considered an extremely prestigious assignment and they attracted some of Starfleet's finest officers. Some Galaxy-class ships were able to house large civilian populations; many assigned personnel even brought their families aboard to live with them.\nIn 2365, the safety of the Galaxy-class, in particular its warp propulsion system, came into question when the USS Yamato was lost in a mysterious accident near the Romulan Neutral Zone. The ship had experienced massive system-wide failures which eventually led to a loss of antimatter containment. Further investigation by the Enterprise-D revealed the malfunctions were the result of an Iconian software transmission and not a design flaw inherent to the ship.\nUndoubtedly the most prominent early Galaxy-class starship was the USS Enterprise-D, which, apart from two brief periods under the commands of William T. Riker and Edward Jellico, was commanded for its entire nine years of service by Captain Jean-Luc Picard. The Enterprise-D made First Contact with a multitude of new species, including the Q Continuum, the Ferengi Alliance and the Borg Collective. Its diplomatic efforts helped cool tensions between smaller, regional powers and prevent dramatic upheavals to the security of the Federation during the Klingon Civil War, and frequently checked Romulan and Cardassian operations in tense situations. It fought off some of the Federation's toughest foes, most notably preventing the assimilation of Earth during the Borg invasion of 2367.\nThe Galaxy-class shared similar design characteristics with the smaller Nebula-class.\nThe design included two hull sections: a saucer-shaped primary hull, and a detachable secondary hull which housed the ship's primary engines. They could be reversibly separated, and were both equipped with independent flight and combat capabilities. Generally, civilians and non-essential personnel would evacuate to the saucer module, while the senior staff confronted a threat in the battle section, which contained the majority of weapons systems. The saucer was even capable of crash-landing on a planetary surface.\nThe interior space of the Galaxy-class was left somewhat customizable; areas such as Deck 8 were designated as unfinished and multi-purpose, in the event that extra space was needed for a specific mission. The Enterprise-D was initially launched from Utopia Planitia, a full 35% of the customizable space was left empty, to be later filled with individual modules as seen fit.\nThe computer system on board the Galaxy-class was isolinear based. Computer systems were concentrated in a computer core, which was accessible through a maintenance room. Each Galaxy-class vessel carried a total of three independent computer cores; two located in the saucer section and one in the engineering section.\nGalaxy-class ships achieved warp flight through two warp nacelles, which housed multiple pairs of warp coils. The acceleration delay between slow-reverse impulse and top warp speed, or about warp 9, was 0.300 milliseconds. The maximum speed was warp 9.6, which could be", "Category: Chamber Music\nMovements: I: VIERGE NR: 1 (1912)\nII: BOITE (1913/14)\nIII: M\u00c9CANISME DE LA PUDEUR (1912)\nPremi\u00e8re recherche pour: La mari\u00e9e mise \u00e0 nu par les c\u00e9libataires\nDuration: 13 minutes\nBass Clarinet in Bb\nPercussion (vibraphone, gong, woodblock, bongo, snare drum, chimes, suspended cymbal, bass bow and two metal knitting needles)\nPiano (In the first movement, the following keys are muted as desired: C-sharp, D, F-sharp and e1, f1, b-flat 1)\nIntroduction: KALEIDOSCOPE \u201eMARCEL DUCHAMP\u201c\nfor flute, bass clarinet, viola, violoncello, percussion & piano\nThe composition refers to three artworks from around 1912 by Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968), a time which marked a turning point in his artistic and intellectual development.

The deuterium tanks were above the core, while antimatter storage pods surrounded the base of the core on Deck 42.\nThere were three impulse engines, two on the saucer section and one in the stardrive section.

One array was located on the dorsal of the battle section and could only be used following a separation. There were also fore and aft torpedo launchers on the engineering section. Each launch tube was capable of firing at least five photon torpedoes simultaneously, each torpedo capable of being independently targeted. In the 2360s, Galaxy-class ships typically carried about 250 photon torpedoes. The torpedo launchers were also capable of launching probes. The Galaxy-class also carried antimatter mines and supported a high-capacity deflector shield grid.\nThe main bridge of the Galaxy-class was located on Deck 1 of the saucer section.

The aft bulkhead carried several additional consoles.\nBy necessity, the bridge had easy access to and from all other important areas of the ship. In all, there were six doors leading from the room. Moving clockwise from the main viewscreen, the first door, level with, and to the right of the conn, led directly to the battle bridge emergency turbolift. At the rear right of the bridge, a shallow alcove contained two doors, one of which led to a head, the other to a corridor leading to the observation lounge. The door at the rear left of the room opened onto a standard turbolift.

Celine arrives and it\u2019s clear that they didn\u2019t reunite eight and a half years ago. Again, they walk and talk \u2013 this time before his flight leaves at sunset. The changes in them are remarkable. They\u2019ve shed much of their 20-something idealism for pragmatism. Jesse\u2019s less douchey. Celine works for the environment. They talk about their lives and their dissatisfactions \u2014 he\u2019s unhappily married with a son, she\u2019s never settled down. Grown up stuff. But the night in Vienna is still there in their minds and the film ebbs and flows around the idea of The One That Got Away \u2014 a concept you can\u2019t really think about until your 30s. Their future is again left ambiguous.\nAnother almost-decade rolls by and Celine and Jesse are together in Before Midnight. They are vacationing in Greece and friends there give them a \u201cnight off\u201d from their kids (who look to be about 8, if you\u2019re doing the math). As you might guess, Celine and Jesse walk and talk to the hotel. There is less energy. They\u2019re obviously working to make the evening \u201cfun\u201d, but the night in Vienna and an afternoon in Paris seem a long way away. They\u2019re consumed with career decisions, life choices, and the \u201ccompromises\u201d they\u2019ve made for one another. Instead of snappy banter, they\u2019re snappish. Are they happy? Is this what true commitment looks like? Is real romance only momentary? And then there\u2019s the hotel room. As with the other films, the viewer is once again asked \u201cWill they be together afterwards?\u201d, but this time the overhanging question is \u201cShould they?\u201d\nI think these films are a remarkable achievement by Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy. They\u2019ve created characters, not caricatures, and allowed them to age and change. At times over the course of the three films you find yourself liking and disliking both Jesse and Celine \u2014 rooting for them, and occasionally against them. Though I\u2019m older now than Jesse and Celine in Before Midnight, I can remember being a 20-something walking the streets of Vienna with a girl. I can remember creating idylls of The One That Got Away in my 30s. I can remember seeing the writing on the wall in hotel rooms.\nThe unusual thing about this series is that I think each one is better than the one before it. Maybe that makes me happy because I think each of my decades has been better than the one before it.\nWill we see Jesse and Celine again in their late 40s/early 50s? I guess we\u2019ll have to wait until 2022. Until then, we can walk and talk about them.", "This actress at one point was on the cusp of A list. Has kid(s). Not married right now.

The primary blockers in front of him, lined up next to one another on the left side were massive tackles James Carpenter and D.J. Fluker.\nOn Tuesday that combination went to another level when during the observation period of practice Carpenter lined up outside of Fluker on the right side where a tight end might normally be. Apparently the idea isn't just a mere flash on the formation radar, but something every opponent will have to prepare for.\n\"You got some big boys to run behind and they're taking care of you,\" Richardson said. \"I'm not scared of anything when I run behind them, not at all.\"\nWhile it'll be a hit with fans, and figures to be this year's equivalent to putting nose tackle Terrence Cody in the backfield near the goal-line, when it comes to Alabama that's about it in terms of unorthodox play-calling. Granted, the Crimson Tide will try a trick play every once in a while, especially if the coaches notice something on film, but otherwise the closest thing to being untraditional in Tuscaloosa is probably the pistol formation or someone other than the quarterback taking a snap.\n\"The wildcat package is something that a lot of teams are preparing for more,\" sophomore guard Barrett Jones said. \"They kind of recognize it and call things for it more, but that's fine with us. Everyone's seen the wildcat.\n\"It is something we definitely want to do, but we also just want to line up and knock people off the ball.\"\nThat's what makes this Saturday's game at Bryant-Denny Stadium such a treat for football purists, because Penn State pretty much plays the same way. It even translates down to both teams wearing such simple, yet elegant uniforms -- many believe the best in college football.\n\"We have a circle around Penn State just because of the standard of excellence they have,\" junior linebacker Chris Jordan said. \"They're going to come out and play hard-nosed football and we like that. We have a standard of excellence ourselves, of being tough to the point of attack, and we're going to just come out and play our type of defense. On offense we're going to go at all cylinders and try and put points on the board.\n\"They're going to try and hit us in the mouth so we better be ready. That's what we've been preparing for this week, a tough game.\"\nIronically, it comes immediately after the most difficult opponent in terms of preparation, San Jose State. New head coach Mike McIntyre was previously the defensive coordinator at Duke, defensive coordinator Kent Baer last held that position at Washington (2005-07) and no one knew for sure what kind of offense the Spartans would execute. Consequently, Alabama spent time preparing for things it never saw in the game.\nThis is the exact opposite. With Joe Paterno in his 45th year as head coach, and 61st year at Penn State, the Nittany Lions are pretty much a what-you-see-is-what-you-get team.\n\"I'm really looking forward to it,\" sophomore lineback", "nt Derek Peake, who has worked in construction for more than 30 years, tells KPRC Ch. 2 that this is the first time he's heard of robbers targeting construction workers.\n\"I was inside the trailer and I heard four small pops and thought, 'That sounds odd,' \" Peake says. \"My foreman came in and said, 'Call the police, call the ambulance quick.'\n\"(The workers) said one guy had a small pistol and one had a knife, and (the robbers) came up and started hollering and cursing, 'Give us all your money.'

I was disappointed to see that it didn\u2019t make the Best Picture list, but there you go. (I\u2019ll admit the only BP films I\u2019ve seen so far are Gravity and Philomena, both of which I really enjoyed.)\nAnyway, in case you don\u2019t know, Before Midnight is the third film in a series (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset) that follow the relationship of an American man, Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) and a French woman, Celine (played by Julie Delpy). Each film is set nine years apart, giving a view into the characters in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. Delpy and Hawke helped write the last two, and all were written and directed by Richard Linklater.\nOver the course of the several months last year, The Beloved and I watched all three of these films \u2014 hardly binge-watching by today\u2019s standards, I suppose. I think they\u2019re very good \u2014 arguably the best film trilogy out there (sorry Peter Jackson) and easily the best set of films about relationships around. They can hardly be called action-packed. The entire series revolves around Jesse and Celine walking and talking \u2014 about relationships, about themselves, about choices, about life.\nIn Before Sunrise, Jesse is a 20-something, single American guy who meets Celine on a train to Vienna. Like any 20-something, single, American guy traveling alone in Europe, Jesse tries to get in her pants (or dress, I suppose) and convinces Celine to spend the evening walking around Vienna as he has a plane to catch early the next morning. As they walk, they talk about the \u201cbig\u201d things 20-year olds talk about \u2014 being true to yourself, never settling, not being like older generations. Jesse\u2019s sort of a douche and she\u2019s got her head in the clouds. They have a perfect night, maybe fall in love, and agree in a moment of bewildering and sleep-deprived romance that rather than exchange information, they\u2019ll return to Vienna in six months if they choose to be together. The audience is left to wonder if they find each other again.\nNine years go by before Before Sunset opens with Jesse \u2014 now a successful author in his 30s doing a book signing in Paris.
