Padosan, in fact, was a family favourite. Her grandmother viewed it each time she wanted a mood elevator.\nBut success chose to play hide and seek with Saira through much of her career. The late 1960s saw the industry being flooded with rumours of Saira being seriously affected by a serious blood disease (it was actually a severe case of colitis).\nSaira Banu's famous songs\nKashmir ki kali hoon main\nTumhein pyar karte hai karte rahenge\nSuman Kalyanpur, Mohammed Rafi\nTumhein aur kya doon main\nAyee Milan Ki Bela\nAiyya ... dil wil pyar vyar\nUnse mili nazar\nJhuk Gaya Aasmaan\nMain chali main chali\nNeele parbaton ki dhara\nAadmi Aur Insaan\nAsha Bhosle, Mahendra Kapoor\nVictoria No 203\nTumre sang toh rain bitayi\nLata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar\nChhotisi umar mein lag gaya rog\nShe had to take a break and lost out on many films including Chhoti Bahu with reigning superstar Rajesh Khanna.\nThe silver lining to the dark clouds was provided by Manoj Kumar. Ignoring all advice, he decided to play the waiting game for Saira to recover. He cast her as the smoking, drinking, miniskirt flaunting Indian girl in Purab Aur Paschim. The film's success accentuated Saira's Westernised image.\nIn the rollicking comedy Victoria No 203 (1972) she may have spent some screen time posing as a man. But there was no mistaking her identity when she wore two towels and tantalised Ranjeet in the sensual Thodasa thehro.\nWhen Sharmila Tagore, Zeenat Aman and Parveen Babi flaunted their sexuality, Saira (who had been bold right from her Mera naam Rita Christina days in April Fool), became the first from the Asha Parekh-Nanda-Sadhana brigade to adapt to the times. Her daring decolletage made her rivals rush to their tailors (designers had still to enter the fray, full-time).\nHer contemporaries Asha Parekh and Sadhana may have shone in the 1960s but by 1972, their halos were dimming. Saira was still a saleable star. The 1970s saw the release of over half a dozen films costarring her with Dharmendra (Aadmi Aur Insaan, Resham Ki Dori, Saazish, Chaitali, International Crook, Jwar Bhata, Pocketmaar).\nMost of these films didn't line the pockets of the distributors but that didn't deter Dharmendra from working with her repeatedly.\nThis was Saira's most fecund phase. She had seven releases in 1974 and did two films (Zameer and Hera Pheri) with Amitabh Bachchan too.\nEver since her marriage to Dilip Kumar, Saira looked for roles with a dramatic centre. Her valiant attempts to establish a reputation as an actress after Gopi, Sagina and Bairaag (all with Dilip Kumar), and films like Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Chaitali met with limited success.\nIn 1976, Saira chose to draw the curtains on her career.\nSubsequently, she has weathered a storm in her marriage, essayed a cameo opposite her husband in Duniya (1984); become a successful television producer but has primarily concentrated on being Mrs Dilip Kumar.", "the bread and cut each slice into two rectangles.

Fantastic. I love him!\nBut\u2026 I don\u2019t love the fight between him and the demon. Occasionally Bill has talked about fights and whatnot that jar him out of the reading\u2014well, this was my moment. The sheer amount of damage? The fact that the creature is so enormously destructive? I know Karsa took down the two Hounds and we know he is some sort of super human but it just seems too much.\nThere is really dark humour in the line: \u201cHe\u2019s probably raping someone!\u201d given what we know of Karsa and his history.\nAnd I do love the scene as Karsa emerges from the keep, and his statement that this massive demon was nothing important.\nThis is simply stunning and I love the ideas therein: \u201cThey could be naught but celestial roads, the paths walked by the dragons of the deep, and Elder Gods and the blacksmiths with suns for eyes who hammered stars into life; and the worlds spinning round those stars were simply dross, cast-offs from the forges, pale and smudged, on which crawled creatures preening with conceit.\u201d\nA slug? With roe? *feels nauseous*\nTeehee\u2014we\u2019ve already discussed the possible identity now of Dassem Ultor, and here we\u2019re having a little re-emphasis of the matter:\n\u201cNo, my friend, the First Sword did not die, and he lives still.\u201d\n\u201cThen where is he?\u201d\n\u201cWhere doesn\u2019t matter. You should ask: Who is he? Ask that, Corabb Bhilan Thenu\u2019alas, and I will give you answer.\u201d\nHow does Leoman know? And what does he know about Dassem Ultor\u2019s ascension?\nSmiles is really prejudiced against the Seti, isn\u2019t she? It\u2019s a little foul to read since it smacks of racism.\nThere are lots of little hints about Bottle starting \u2013 the fact he knows Leoman is heading for Y\u2019Ghatan, possibly those lizards? Aha, yes, the lizards are used for spying. I remember from Memories of Ice.\nSo Bottle has the potential to draw on more warrens than Quick Ben? Is this because of the Eres\u2019al? And where did Quick Ben get his power from? Dear Lord, it does get frustrating when we get back to the points where I am asking more questions during the reading than answering.\nAnother hint that the warrens are pretty unbalanced: \u201cBy warren? They shouldn\u2019t be doing that, you know. Not now. Not here\u2026\u201d\nYep, those warrens are pretty messed up! Nice little cliffhanger there featuring Quick Ben and Kalam en route to Y\u2019Ghatan\u2014where are they now? And what chaos is in store for them. Oh, and I totally laughed at:\n\u201cThe Fourteenth\u2019s motto,\u201d Stormy said, with a loud sigh.\n\u201cWhich?\u201d Gesler asked. \u201cAnd then we leave or No heroic stands?\u201d\n\u201cTake your pick.\u201d\nBill\u2019s Reaction to Chapter Three\nClearly the poem is clueing us in that Y\u2019Ghatan is going to be of some importance and by the end of the chapter it seems the final battle between Leoman\u2019s army and the Fourteenth will take place there. The sense of the buried past, the past that lives, is a constant theme in this series, so no surprise we see it mentioned here, but perhaps also not a coincidence that \u201cbones\u201d play such a role as well in this poem, considering our book\u2019s title.\nAnd from the tragic dignity of the poem to our resident comic relief\u2014this cracks me up every time this discussion over the urn. And coming after our earlier introduction to these two, where we learned they were familiar with Starvald Demelain and where Telorast hissed in \u201creptilian fashion,\u201d we should perhaps as Amanda says note Telorast\u2019s desire for a body with wings.\nA nice transition echo from the poem that opens to Apsalar\u2019s view of the city: \u201ccrouched on the sun-baked clay . . . the city . . . like something dead in the night.\u201d\nI find her musings over Cutter\u2019s naivety sad and a bit moving. Her use of his original name\u2014Crokus\u2014for one. The fact that he had been na\u00efve and no longer is for another. And the way it also calls up the image of a na\u00efve young girl on a road near her fishing town who is now a reluctant assassin who thinks herself unworthy of love. And then a few paragraphs later, equally sad is her attempt to force herself to be that assassin, uncaring and unthinking because it is what she is. And her dream of walking away into a new life.\nI like the two mystery folks we get teased with in her thoughts: the final target and the one she might ask about walking away (we have met him before if you can recall someone near this city who had in fact made himself a new life by disappearing)\n\u201cYou are so unsuited to be a god, Cotillion.\u201d That has to be one of the nicest things anyone has said about him. And I think it is a great way to sum him up.\nOkay, the Apsalar near-caress. Let\u2019s have at it\u2026.\nHave I mentioned before how much I love this character\u2014Cotillion? His humanity, his compassion, his empathy. The sad way he reacts to that touch. His heavy remorse over what he has done to her. The way he can smile at the thought of her visiting an old friend.\n\u201cThe east horizon was in flames with the rising of the sun.\u201d\nI also like how Apsalar is taking the initiative to find out what was going on with Mebra because Cotillion had been \u201cshaken\u201d by the news.\nAnd again, you have to laugh at Telorast and Curdle\u2019s response to the sun: \u201cBy the Abyss, there\u2019s a sun in this world? Have they gone mad?\u201d\nI think you\u2019re okay with where Apsalar is in the canal city. I think it\u2019s another example of how Shadows overlay Shadows, how the warren is layered, almost like parallel dimensions sharing the same space-time.\nRuthless is right in the description of Apsalar, which is an interesting and somewhat jarring to the reader depiction coming after seeing her so sad and depressed and then so soft with Cotillion. Keeps us on our toes and reminds us these characters are multi-faceted.\nKarpolan is one of the original founders of the Guild and therefore pretty high up, and, as we\u2019ve seen in Deadhouse Gates, pretty good at what he does (he delivers the box of munitions to Fiddler at the end amidst all that madness).\nThere\u2019s that city Y\u2019Ghatan again.\nAnd yes, those Guild rides are \u201chairy\u201d indeed.\nThe Shadow Dance is part of the Shadow cult and yes, is connected to assassination. Think of Cotillion known as \u201cDancer.\u201d Recall as well that Lostara is a Shadow Dancer.\nYou\u2019re right on all points regarding Veed, Amanda.\nLoved Karsa getting into the Keep. Loved the reactions outside though. Loved the exit scene. Not so much the fight itself, like Amanda, though I did enjoy one aspect of it\u2014the very \u201cHuge Barbarian\u201d/Conan/Tarzan aspect of it. But let\u2019s not go away without filing \u201cshort tail\u201d reptile.\nIt\u2019s rare I think that Erikson waxes so poetical as that description of the stars\u2014wouldn\u2019t mind if we had more of that throughout. This is just a beautiful passage.\nLeoman\u2019s knowledge of Dassem is certainly intriguing. It\u2019s a bit slapsticky, but I did like the humor in Corabb\u2019s ignorantly ironic \u201cBlessed Dessembrae . . .\u201d And the little throwaway \u201che wanders . . .\u201d I have to admit I don\u2019t recall if we know why or learn why Leoman knows this. Anyone?\nLeoman is pretty ominous in his words I\u2019d say. What does he have planned that makes him wonder if Corabb will follow his orders? What about those orders will seem like \u201cmadness\u201d? What will make the Malazans \u201ccurse\u201d the name of Y\u2019Ghatan \u201cfor all time\u201d? Why are his plans a \u201cburden\u201d? Why does he care if it is \u201cpast cursing season\u201d with the olives?\n- Leoman \u201cthe gaze seemingly fixed on the licking flames\u201d\n- Leoman \u201cslowly nodded, eyes once more on the flames.\u201d\n- \u201cThe trail of fire.\u201d\n- \u201cOur trail of fire.\u201d\nAnother one of those nice Erikson transitions, from the fire of Leoman and Corabb to Koryk blowing on a fire, \u201cinhaling a cloud of ashes.\u201d\nNeffarias Bred, if you recall, was an infantry \u201cheavy\u201d whose exploits were the thing of legend mentioned in House of Chains: \u201cI heard he killed eighteen raiders all in one night . . .

She thinks the last person on her list of targets will be the hardest, tries to convince herself to simply do it, then thinks maybe she\u2019ll talk to someone nearby about how to walk away. Cotillion appears and they discuss Mebra, Telorast and Curdle, Edgewalker, her future, and her upcoming visit.\nTelorast and Curdle fade at the sunrise, much to their dismay. Apsalar finds the Pardu women and Gral from the night before. Upon her return, Telorast and Curdle tell her someone was in her room, though their description is a bit confusing.\nApsalar and the two ghosts return to Mebra\u2019s place. The Pardu women arrive, Apsalar incapacitates them, and learns their employer is Karpolan Demesand of the Trygalle Trade Guild. The Pardu woman says they are returning from Y\u2019Ghatan and they were trying to purchase information from Mebra. Apsalar explains what happened then knocks her out.

He is attacked by a giant short-tailed lizard and they fight.\nOutside, Samar Dev, Captain Inashan and others wonder at the noise within. Samar Dev tells them the Keep is ancient and had been filled with strange mechanisms.\nKarsa kills the lizard.\nKarsa appears outside, looking terrible. He tells them he didn\u2019t see any Malazans and leaves.\nCorabb and Leoman discuss their destination: Y\u2019Ghatan. Leoman corrects Corabb\u2019s mistaken believe that Dassem Ultor died there and tells him Dassem ascended and is Dessembrae, The Lord of Tragedy. He adds he is a \u201creluctant god\u201d and is in constant flight and/or possibly eternally hunting.

I can just imagine Curdle taking on a chamber pot as her new body in error. Erikson likes to throw in these little clues: \u201cYou want something alive. Really alive, with legs that work. Or wings\u2026\u201d\nI find it curious that Apsalar considers Cutter to be naive. I mean, I do as well, but I also think you can level the same charge at Apsalar herself. Sure she has some of the memories of Cotillion, but that doesn\u2019t mean she has any true experience. Certainly when it comes to love and feelings she seems very naive. I can\u2019t help thinking, in fact, that Cutter and Apsalar are incredibly well suited, if only they could realise it.\nHmm, now we find out that Apsalar\u2019s task is to kill a succession of people listed by Shadowthrone and Cotillion, \u201cwith the final target the most challenging of all\u2026\u201d And someone she feels no enmity towards. I guess we should start wondering who that person is. Has Erikson already started dropping little clues and I\u2019m just missing them?\nI like this: \u201cStill, what made a god decide to kill some lowly mortal? The minor irritation of a stone in a moccasin. The slap of a branch on a wooded trail.\u201d We\u2019ve seen a number of occasions now where a mortal has proved to be much, much more than gods expect them to be.\nWe\u2019ve spoken about the odd relationship between Apsalar and Cotillion before\u2014here there is more to fuel it: \u201cShe reached up with one hand and brushed the line of his jaw, the gesture close to a caress. She caught the sudden intake of his breath, the slight widening of his eyes, but he would not look at her.\u201d This seems to have hints of romance about it.\nI am glad that Cotillion feels remorse for what he did to Apsalar\u2014it was a grotesque action and he continues to use her (although with her assent), but he clearly have intentions of leaving her in a better position. I feel so sorry for her.\nOoh! Who is it that Apsalar is going to drop in on? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out very soon, but my curiosity is piqued now!\nIt is interesting that someone is spying on Apsalar and trying to find out about her while she does the same to other people. Obviously she has been noted. A big, black, hairy demon with fangs and claws wearing boots, hmm? No one immediately comes to mind with that description, although my memory could be failing me.\nJust as an aside and a possible discussion point, even when given a description of what a person or creature looks like, I generally don\u2019t keep a visual of them in my head. I tend to gloss over the description. I know some people read really visually and can see everything represented down to the last hair and blade of grass, but I struggle to do this. Which kind of reader are you?\nSpeaking of not being able to picture things, I\u2019m struggling to understand what this shadowy aqueduct thing is and where it has come from!

I would be asking more questions about where it\u2019s come from and who provided it\u2026 Certainly Apsalar isn\u2019t able to pin down Telorast or Curdle on it:\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cIt is from the Shadow Realm, isn\u2019t it? It has to be. Otherwise I would be unable to see it.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. We think. Don\u2019t we, Telorast?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely. Or not.\u201d\nIt sounds like they might be in a different fragment of Kurald Emurlahn (dear God, that is difficult to spell!), especially because they see some Tiste Edur.

Except\u2026mention of \u201ca most delicious throne\u201d\u2026 Curious. The Shadow Throne\u2014the real one? Or another throne? (Especially because Telorast says: \u201cYou have lost your mind.

She takes down these two Pardu caravan guards effortlessly, and is utterly ruthless in extracting information. Nasty.

Cast as an innocent Kashmir ki kali who reduces the wild city cad Shammi Kapoor to a puddle of devotion, Saira exuded freshness and friskiness.\nFilmalaya's Junglee created hysteria.

Initially, filmmakers couldn't see beyond that. Saira was willing to learn (the novice dancer would keep a studio open at Filmalaya Studios to practise her dancing and became a proficient Kathak artiste).\nBut most of her 1960s films showed her either shrieking (who can forget the roof-shattering \"You... farebi\" from April Fool), simpering (\"Samjhao apne dil ko\" she whispers to an excited Rajendra Kumar while he drools Aaj ki raat yeh kaisi raat in Aman), or squealing (the famous Aiyaa from Shagird).\nAayee Milan Ki Bela (1964) witnessed both, the mehboob of the audience Rajendra Kumar, and the hunk-in the-making Dharmendra ardently wooing Saira. The film's success ensured that Saira and Rajendra teamed in three films in succession: Aman, Jhuk Gaya Aasman and K Asif's incomplete Sasta Khoon Mehnga Paani.\nThose who linked her with the much-married Rajendra Kumar were silenced when Saira wed tragedy king Dilip Kumar (ironically, Rajendra Kumar's inspiration) in 1966. Saira willingly sublimated her single image for this May-December pairing, but did not stop acting in films.\nSaira had starred regularly with Mukherjee scion Joy in many a clunker, but the 1967 hit Shagird proved a welcome wedding present.

You can read the original version here.\nHave you ever been in a position where you are in meetings during the day, and then you code at night just to feel that you are getting things done? I know I have.\"\nIn 2009, Paul Graham wrote an article about the maker vs manager schedule. It articulates that meetings are disastrous when we are on the maker's schedule. When we attend many meetings, it is tough to focus on the task and get things done. In my case, even a single meeting can blow my whole afternoon.\nMost of us have two workdays in today's world - one on the manager's schedule and the other on the maker's schedule.\nIn his article, Paul proposes using office hours and setting aside a time for meetings. But I struggled with this when acting as the team lead for one of the teams and found my day broken up by various meetings. After all, how do we tell our boss (and the rest of the business) that we have office hours and will only meet him/her/them during those? I think office hours works well when we are high enough on the totem pole.\nSince office hours are not viable for most of us, we can try the next best thing - blocking out chunks of time in our calendar for focus time. Blackout periods work well in most cases, but we still have to attend meetings and can't get stuck on a task for the whole day.\nLet us look at something that works a little better - A no-meeting day.\nWhat is a No-Meeting Day?\nA no-meeting day is a day for focused work. Essentially, it's a day in the week with no meetings so that we get uninterrupted time to do our job. This continuous focus time is perfect for deep work and more extensive projects. In addition, there is less context switching, so it's easier to achieve that magical state of flow.\nAnd if you are a manager, it also allows you to be a doer.\nA No-meeting day will never work for my role.\nNow some of you might be reading this and going -\nYeah, it sounds great, and I would love to get in on that action, but it will never work for my role\nSome functions like Sales and Customer Success will require more collaboration than others.\nFor these roles, it might be better to institute blackout periods", "What are the qualifications and requirements for a Call Center Manager according to the text", "esults will be recorded and their bookmarking will be reset.

EPA certificates are expected in January 2017. Power ratings will be set at R3 (for 450hp), and R4 for both 510 and 550hp. The IPS system, engine, drive and propellers are expected to be approved by DNV-GL. The inboard engine will also require certificates, which will be applied for from the classification societies: DNV-GL, RINA, LR, China CSS, RS and the Indian Register of Shipping (IRS). The engine will be ready for delivery in June 2017.\nMeet the IPS15\nVolvo Penta\u2019s Inboard Performance System (IPS) is the showcase of the company\u2019s innovations in marine engineering, and last week the IPS family added a fourth member, the IPS15, which has been developed and optimized to fit the D8 engines for the commercial market. Since its inception in 2005, Volvo Penta has continuously worked to develop its IPS pods to offer an integrated propulsion package with greater performance, fuel efficiency, maneuverability and comfort.\n\u201cIt is all about propulsion efficiency and productivity for the yards, designers and operators. This is a fantastic move for us and our customers,\u201d says Jakob Ursby, strategy manager for Volvo Penta\u2019s Marine Commercial sector.\nThe IPS design features forward-facing twin counter-rotating propellers which are mounted beneath the hull. As the propellers operate in undisturbed water, they cause less drag, which Volvo Penta claims improves performance and fuel consumption by up to 30% compared to traditional inboard engines. Features of the type approved IPS15 package include:\n\u2022 Improved materials for heavy-duty commercial use.\n\u2022 Reduced ratio of weight and hydrodynamic resistance.\n\u2022 Reduced ratio of hull insert size.\n\u2022 Optimized backpressure with 6-inch exhaust system.\n\u2022 A new propeller series (N) custom fit for the system.\n\u2022 Improved maneuverability with increased steering angle at low speed.\nCentral to Volvo Penta\u2019s commercial marine market push is the offer of a comprehensive, integrated solution. While the engines and IPS are central components, the entire package includes a family of intuitive and integrated controls, encompassing a joystick option, docking mode and dynamic positioning; it includes Humphree trim and stabilization products, as Volvo Penta recently took a majority stake (80%) in the iconic company; and it include the \u2018glass cockpit\u2019 solution, which ties together critical operational information in one neat, customizable package.\nInstallation of the IPS with 8-liter engines can be made for twin and triple configurations. For triple installations, one pod can also be disengaged and the engine can be used in PTO mode \u2013 for example, in powering a water canon on fire rescue boats - while still keeping maneuverability on the other two. The new package has three power settings:\nThe package has been designed to conform to US EPA Tier 3 emissions.

You can start with blackout periods if your manager is concerned and then move up to no-meeting days. Once you have a few blackout periods in your calendar for focus time, it is an easier sell to consolidate them into a single no-meeting day.\nStep 2: Next, communicate with others about your availability on no meeting days. Have a plan for how or when you are available in case of work emergencies.\nStep 3: The final step is to ensure that no meetings can be scheduled on your nominated no-meeting day. Create a recurring all-day event on your calendar that blocks others from scheduling time with you.\nStep 4: Once you are happy with the trial, roll it out to the rest of the team.\nGetting the whole team to buy-in from the start\nPeople make a big mistake and set themselves up for failure because they try to get the whole team to agree to try it from the outset.

Like the transporter in our nerves, it has a bundle of twelve alpha helices that form a transport channel through the membrane. LeuT is more compact than our transporter, however, and is missing several extensions at the ends of the chain that interact with proteins in the nerve cell. The transport function is similar, though, and is even inhibited by compounds like antidepressants that block transport of neurotransmitters. So, the bacterial protein is providing a powerful model for studying the atomic details of the nerve protein.\nSodium SymportLeuT is one of dozens of transporters that shuttle amino acids in and out of bacterial cells. LeuT specializes in small hydrophobic amino acids like leucine and alanine. The transport is powered by the gradient of sodium ions that is normally maintained by healthy cells across their membranes. LeuT acts as a symporter, which links the passage of a sodium ion across the membrane with the transport of the amino acid in the same direction.\nLooking at LeuTThe crystal structures solved by NYCOMPS researchers, included in PDB entries 2q6h, 2q72, 2qb4, 2qei, and 2qju, capture LeuT frozen by the antidepressant in the middle of performing its job. An amino acid (shown in yellow) is bound deep inside the protein, held by two sodium ions (shown in green). The protein recognizes all aspects of the amino acid, forming specific interactions with both the amino group and the acid group, and forming a hydrophobic pocket perfectly fitted to the small hydrophobic sidechain.\nRocker BlockerThe protein is thought to act like a rocker switch. It starts with an opening towards the outside of the cell. Leucine and sodium enter and bind, then the protein shifts to open inside the cell, releasing the amino acid and sodium.

That race is wide open after Republican incumbent Larry McCown decided against running for re-election.\nDistrict 1 Commissioner Tresi Houpt, a Democrat, is not up for re-election this year.\nUnder Democratic party rules, anyone who wanted to run as a Democrat for county commissioner had to notify Sands about his or her intent to run at least 10 days before the party\u2019s county assembly, which is scheduled for Saturday. With the deadline already passed, the only people who announced their intention to run were Carter and Bershenyi, Sands said.\nHowever, Sands noted the 10-day rule can be waived by a majority vote at the county assembly, but he added that \u201cmost people follow the rule.\u201d\nAny challenger can still get on the ballot for the Aug. 12 primary if he or she can receive 30 percent of the vote at the county assembly. Although Carter and Bershenyi have announced their candidacies, they still have to receive at least 30 percent of the vote at the party\u2019s county assembly to be placed on the ballot, Sands said.\nA challeng", "e protector.

My advice is: Achieve what you want to achieve in high school. Get out of high school what you want to get out of high school. Do, to some extent, what you want to do.\nThroughout high school, I enrolled myself in as hard a class schedule as I could find. But because I did that, I gave up spending time with friends and full nights of sleep.\nIn order to fulfill my difficult class schedule, I ended up taking classes I wasn\u2019t interested in. I took human anatomy to help my GPA, even though the last time I was really interested in biological sciences was when I was 10 years old and wanted to study dinosaurs.\nTaking those hard classes has definitely paid off in the ways I wanted it to, but I made sacrifices, too. The sacrifices were made bearable by the fact that I had chosen this path, and the payoff was what I\u2019d decided I wanted out of my high school career. I\u2019m at the top of my graduating class, and I\u2019m going to the University of Notre Dame.\nIf you have decided, like I did, that this intensely academic path is the right one for you, that\u2019s great. But if you don\u2019t want to make those sacrifices, or if your goals in high school are a little different, ease up.

Last week off the west coast of Sweden, Maritime Reporter & Engineering News got up close and personal with the new D8 diesel and IPS15 pod, as well as the full range of command and control products courtesy of a day of test drives at Krossholmen, Volvo Penta\u2019s Global Marine Testing Center. In the middle of a financial storm such as the one that swept the globe in 2008/2009 it is not easy to see a \u2018silver lining.\u2019 However Stefan Carlsson, Volvo Penta\u2019s Marine Diesel segment head said that the dramatic drop in marine leisure business in 2009 set the company in a new strategic direction, determined to maximize efficiencies while diversifying its business into the commercial sector. Cracking into the rigorous commercial market is easier said than done, but with perseverance and a steady expansion of its product and service, Volvo Penta now offers a compelling argument as a one-stop-shop for a variety of workboat sectors.\nNew Product: The D8 Diesel Engine\nWell-engineered products with a solid support infrastructure is mandatory in the workboat sector, and last week Volvo Penta effectively broadened it product range to compete more efficiently. The company introduced the D8 engine \u2013 which will replace the D9 \u2013 built to U.S. Tier III and IMO II specification and available in 450, 510 and 550 hp models.\nThe 8-liter engine expands the offering between the D6 and D11 models, for applications that require low weight with high power suited for propeller, waterjet and Volvo Penta IPS applications. The new engine has been designed for use in planing craft, and commercial uses include fast patrols, coast guard and rescue launches, police and ambulance boats, water-taxis and high-speed passenger ferries, fishing boats, and offshore support vessels.\nWhile the D8 is new to the marine market, it is a well-proven platform which has been manufactured since 2013 serving the truck, buss and off-road industrial market. Krossholmen proves an ample testing ground for anything on the water, as Volvo Penta runs a diverse test boat fleet of more than three dozen boats, ranging in size to 70 feet in length.\nThe D8 is an in-line six-cylinder engine with a cylinder capacity of 7.7 liters, twin-entry turbo and sea-water cooled heat exchanger, a heat exchanger manufactured of composite material to eliminate corrosion. The engine has a common rail system (Denso) working up to 2000 bars. The injection is electronically controlled, and pre-, main, and post-injection are essential aspects for the engine\u2019s power, torque, fuel efficiency, low noise and emission levels.\n\u201cThe high power-to-weight ratio together with the new common rail injection system where the nozzle has been optimized, together with a piston bowl of re-entry type, will provide excellent fuel efficiency,\u201d said Anna Pettersson, chief project manager for Volvo Penta\u2019s marine engines.\nVolvo Penta has developed three power outputs for the D8 inboard range \u2013 of 450, 510 and 550hp.
