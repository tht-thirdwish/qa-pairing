Owning a 12-string, I was obviously very intimate with guitar-tuning. This was the dawn of PC chips, remember, and suddenly one came out that could 'read' audio frequencies. It occurred to me that you could incorporate twelve of them to look for a specific frequency and send a plus or minus signal to a mini-servomotor attached to each tuning key, telling it to turn one direction or the other. You'd strum the guitar once and they'd all kick into gear.\nHe's threatening you.\nSince it's Sunday and we're just horsing around, I'll run through his little list, just for practice:\nTornadoes \u2014 We're currently at a 10-year low in twister activity \u2014 despite an ever-mounting rise of 'killer carbon', CO2.\nHurricanes \u2014 Also at an historic low, and some global climatologists are now starting to think that warmer waters reduce the number and strength of hurricanes.\nDroughts \u2014 Our current drought is nothing compared to the barn-burner of the Dust Bowl 30's.\nCoastal Flooding \u2014 Ah, you can always tell somebody who grew up in a landlocked state. It's like he's never even seen an oceanside beach. He's picturing the entire surrounding land mass as being at or near sea level, whereupon a few-feet rise in ocean level would devastate everything for miles around. Yet San Francisco, for example, surrounded on three sides by water and obviously one of the first to be washed away, is 15 feet above sea level.\nHold on, this just in:\nWhere we we? Oh, right.\nWildfires \u2014 We have definitely seen bigger and bigger wildfires in recent times, and will continue to do so. And it has everything to do with poor brush management and the poor clearing of old timber and not maintaining a proper airborne fleet and nothing to do with the weather.\nMass Extinctions \u2014 As I point out in my own AGW treatise, the funny thing about the \"species dying off\" meme is that we have absolutely no friggin' idea how many species there are. So, if you don't have a starting number, how do you know when there are \"less\"?\nBut the real point is that there isn't any reason to think masses of species will die off simply because it gets a bit warmer. Colder, yeah, but warmer? And for those on the cusp who actually do die out, a lesser species will find the warmer temp a boon and flourish.

Indie music fans joined classic rock and hip hop lovers for three days of incredible music highlighted by sets from Kanye West, Alt-J, Kings of Leon, Guns N\u2019 Roses, The xx, and Grizzly Bear (as well as a shit ton of mud, which you\u2019ll hear more about below). For quick facts about the festival, our awards, and gorgeous photos by Luis Ruiz, keep scrolling!\nThe setup: Hosted on New York City\u2019s Randall\u2019s Island, Governors Ball was a three-day festival featuring tons of amazing artists including Alt-J, ON AN ON, Kanye West, Kings of Leon, Haim, and The xx. In the three years its existed, Governors Ball has grown unlike any festival I\u2019ve ever witnessed. The two stages at last year\u2019s fest were replaced by four massive stages which were all close enough to walk between in under 10 minutes. This year saw an extra emphasis on the food \u2014 more amazing vendors than ever got involved and surrounded all stages with the smells of pure heaven (if you could smell it through the mud).\nWeather: If you read anything at all about this past weekend, you know we got quite the storm here in New York. It rained the entire day on Friday which turned the grassy fields of the park into a pit of 6-12 inch deep smelly mud. While it only rained on Friday, the rest of the weekend saw the repercussions.\nFood options: As I mentioned above, there were more food options than ever this year. The stages were surrounded by food stands and trucks, all serving different creative cuisines from New York based restaurants such as Crif Dog, Rickshaw Dumping Bar, Porchetta, Luke\u2019s, and Arancini Bros. It might have been expensive, but the food was all well worth heading to the festival hungry.\nOverall crowdedness: As could have been expected, the rain kept some people away on Friday, and likely the rest of the weekend. By Kanye West\u2019s set on Sunday, however, it looked as if all the ticket-holders made it out. While it was super busy, it was never uncomfortably packed and most importantly, the bathroom line never took more than 10 minutes. Ugh, I don\u2019t want to think about those bathrooms ever again.\nNot your festival if: If you don\u2019t like the smell, sight, and/or feeling of mud, you would have been miserable this weekend. If not for the mud, though, there really weren\u2019t many things not to like. I highly suggest this festival to anyone who likes great music.\nUnnecessary visual effects: While the main stage at the festival has 3 mega screens set up for Kanye West\u2019s set, they really didn\u2019t do anything to help out the thousands of people that had to stand in the distance. The video footage of Kanye was psychedelic looking \u2014 they used what looks like low-budget iPhoto/Photo Booth effect as make the screens useless.\nBest set from converting Kanye fans to indie-lovers: We were in a prime spot for the Kanye set, which just so hap", "Gran to her 22 great-grandchildren.\nIn lieu of flowers donations to St John Ambulance would be appreciated and may be left in the Chapel Atrium.\nA service to celebrate Marjorie\u2019s life will be held in the Cleveland Chapel, 179 Ingestre Street, Wanganui, on Saturday, 8th of September 2018, at 1:00 PM.\nANDERSON, Marjorie Gladys Rose: Beloved sister of Jacqueline and (the late) Lionel Gillam, and Eric and Pamela Bryan.", "For weeks, Kanye West, who also goes by Ye, has taken to Instagram to express his frustration with various brands.\nNow, it appears, he\u2019s doing something about it.\nWest\u2019s lawyers are terminating the contract between his company Yeezy, and clothing retailer Gap, according CNBC.\nThe letter states that the retailer failed to meet its obligations in the agreement.\nGap was reportedly required to sell 40% of the Yeezy Gap assortment in brick-and-mortar retail stores during the third and fourth quarters of 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cYeezy notified Gap of its concerns in August and gave the company a contractually-designated 30 days to cure its breaches,\u201d said Nicholas Gravante, a lawyer", "06 345 5522\n173 - 179 Ingestre Street, Wanganui\nPassed away on September 04 2018\n23.6.1938 - 4.9.2018.

But solving the mystery any time soon may be forestalled by plans to shut down one of the satellites in September.\nThe explosion in question is a powerful burst of X-rays called an X-ray flash that was observed by NASA's Swift and High Energy Transient Explorer-2 satellites. X-ray flashes seem to be related to gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful explosions in the universe. \"No one understands this relationship at all. It's a complete mystery,\" said Lamb, the Louis Block Professor in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and a member of the HETE-2 science team.\nLamb presents some ideas on the relationship of X-ray flashes to gamma-ray bursts during a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Minneapolis. The co-authors of his paper are Tim Donaghy, a Ph.D. student in physics, and Carlo Graziani, Senior Research Associate in Astronomy & Astrophysics, both at the University of Chicago.\nDiscovered in 1969, Gamma-ray bursts last anywhere from fractions of a second to many minutes and pack the output of as many as 1,000 exploding stars. They occur almost daily, come from any direction in the sky, and are followed by afterglows that are visible for a few days at X-ray and optical wavelengths.\nDiscovered in 2000, X-ray flashes seem to form the less powerful end of a continuum of cosmic explosions that progresses to X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts and then culminates in gamma-ray bursts proper. All three phenomena occur in approximately equal numbers.\n\"We think that regular gamma-ray bursts are all produced by the collapse of massive stars and probably the creation of black holes,\" Lamb said. \"I personally think it's essentially a certainty that X-ray flashes are produced by the same kind of event.\"\nBut exactly how that occurs remains a matter of speculation. One possibility is that a varying rotation rate of the collapsed core of these massive stars produces different opening angles of the jets emitted from the bursts. \"Maybe sometimes they're rotating rapidly and you get narrow jets and other times they're rotating less rapidly and you get wider X-ray rich jets and sometimes they're rotating still more slowly and you get very broad jets that prod", "[bas relief by Oleh Lesiuk]\nThe Western Mail, April 20th, 1933\nO.G.P.U.\u2019s BLOW TO TRADE\n- - -\nMOSCOW TRIAL ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLUNDERS IN HISTORY\nForeign Trade Wrecked by Fanatical Suspicion\nBy Gareth Jones\nThe trial of the\nBritish engineers in Moscow will rank as one of the biggest blunders of\nhistory. The false step which the O.G.P.U. (the State Political Police)\nblindly took when they ordered the arrest of the six Britons has had results\ngreatly damaging to the Soviet Union. The O.G.P.U. went about the frame-up\nwithout consulting anybody.

According to the Bolsheviks, the\ncapitalists are ever plotting the overthrow of the Soviet Union and send swarms\nof spies to Russia.\nAmerica are preparing war on the Soviet Union. The Pope and the Hitlerites\nare allies in preparing to attack the Soviet Union.\u201d\nThose are typical\npropaganda posters which one sees everywhere.

What wonder that most British experts or observers going to\nRussia are suspected of being spies?\nThe O.G.P.U. is\nfanatical in another of its suspicions, namely, the relations between British\npeople and the Intelligence Service. The Bolsheviks really believe that\nScotland Yard (which they confuse with the British Intelligence Service) is an\nall-powerful force dominating British life.

I\u2019m straight (androphilic, or attracted to men), my personality and presentation fit pretty neatly into the culturally mandated female gender role and concept of femininity, I \u201cpass\u201d reasonably well (or more accurately, I have the privilege of usually being gendered correctly), I transitioned while still somewhat young, I never considered being non-op and keeping my male genitals to be a reasonable option for me, I took the conventional model of medical treatment, my diagnosis was easily made and my narrative fit the standard criteria, and I identify in a nice, simple, binary, easily understood, totally-female way.\nThe only way in which I fall outside the (horrible and internally cissexist) concept of \u201cHarry Benjamin Syndrome\u201d is that I previously identified as a gay man and was (a little bit) sexually active during that time. Like many of the ways I\u2019ve gotten very lucky with my transition, fitting into cis expectations and being more or less the most easily comprehensible \u201ctype\u201d of transsexual there is (just moving from the M box to the F box, and not clashing too much with society\u2019s standards for that F) has made things much easier for me than they otherwise would have been. The world is a pretty hostile place for trans women who pose additional threats to cisnormative concepts of gender.\nBut nonetheless, I didn\u2019t really have the archetypal childhood most cis people imagine a trans woman to have. Almost no one does. I wasn\u2019t putting on dresses and playing with dolls and insisting I was a girl from the moment I could talk. Despite the way that many cis people imagine that is how all trans women start out in life, that kind of story is actually incredibly rare. Very few of us assert strong outward signs like that in early childhood\u2026 even those of us who came to understand our identity as female before adolescence still usually knew that we wouldn\u2019t be accepted, that it wasn\u2019t allowed, and we had to keep that side of ourselves secret and suppressed lest we be ridiculed or punished or disappoint our parents. We adapt and we hide. Kids are smarter than adults tend to think, they know how vulnerable they are and they want to please the people around them, especially their parents.\nBesides, I didn\u2019t have any sisters anyway, so opportunities to play with girl toys and explore femininity as an option were pretty scarce. I mostly just stuck with Lego. I liked making up my own stories and characters.\nBut that didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t moments where I tried to explore, and discovered the scorn with which femininity would be met. My knowing to hide beneath a male disguise wasn\u2019t natural. It was very definitely learned. One of the ways I learned it was through My Little Pony. I liked My Little Pony.\nI have a particularly vivid memory of how one day my father came into the room where we had the TV and caught me watching the MLP cartoon. I will never, ever forget the look of disappointment, frustration, confusion and most of all disgust on his face. Whether he really thought it through or not, he made it abundantly clear that it was NOT okay for me to be watching such a show, that it was indicative of there being something wrong with me, and I ought to be ashamed. I got to know that look pretty well. I encountered it many more times over the course of my childhood\u2026 the only difference being that over the years the frustration and disgust gradually sank into resignation and sadness (the disappointment and confusion remain even today).\nI also remember going to a birthday party for one of my older brother\u2019s friends (I have no idea why I was there\u2026 I guess so my parents could get a night of free babysitting and relax). The birthday boy\u2019s older brother gave him his gift, he opened it, and discovered a My Little Pony. The assembled crowd of boys in the room laughed at him, and I instinctively knew that I was expected to laugh along: how gross and awful and horrible and hilarious that this boy would be holding a girl thing in his hands! LOL! It was my first experience of what would later come back to haunt me as the laugh track to Work It. The awful, sickening feeling of knowing you\u2019re supposed to participate in the transphobic ridicule. The boy actually began to sob in humiliation before his brother finally revealed that it had been a joke and gave him his real gift (a Nerf gun).\nI knew exactly what lesson was being taught. Kids are smart like that. It was wrong to like girl things, and if you did, you would be mocked, laughed at, hated, shunned, people would be disgusted by you, and you\u2019d be a disappointment to your parents. And nothing was girlier than My Little Pony. I knew I was not allowed to have one, or even dare breathe that I wanted one.\nAs such, My Little Pony became representative to me of everything I\u2019d been denied. All the joys, desires, and expressions of self I had been forced to hide and suppress. Everything I never got to have. The girlhood I wasn\u2019t allowed to live, that is now lost forever. The years I never lived and the experiences I never had. A missed childhood. All of it summed up in one little toy I wished I could have asked for, and one cartoon my father caught me watching.\nIt\u2019s not that I think feminine things, and girl toys, or the colour pink or whatever, are synonymous with female identity. My views are quite apart from that, though I am femme. But we all construct, imagine and express our gender with the tools we have available. The value, and the loss, was symbolic.\nYears later, early in my transition, when I was a few months into hormones but still presenting as male, I spent a particular Spring morning hanging around on a trans support forum on the internet when I noticed a lot of people were using avatars from the new My Little Pony cartoon that had come out. I loved the art, I thought the ponies were adorable, and I thought it was really cool that My Little Pony was being claimed as a bit of an icon by the younger MtF community, in that for me it was such a powerful symbol for the joys of femininity, and like I said, symbolic of the things I had wished I could have had and wished I could have been but had to sacrifice, symbolic of the girlhood I missed out on. It was a nice morning.\nBut that day didn\u2019t end up going very well.\nAt this point, I was terrified to death of coming out and what I was going to do about my roommates.

There will be a couple of points that will remain about defining powertrain, but basically, our point is that anti-tampering doesn\u2019t really have a place in this draft law,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a member state issue.\u201d\nThat would certainly please the motorcycle community and groups working to lobby parliament against the law, or certain provisions within it.

The issue of ABS may still be a cause of concern to motorcyclists. According to Reynolds, the committee remains in favor of requiring ABS for all full-sized motorcycles. The debate on the issue is centered on whether or not the law should also require scooters to come with ABS as a required feature.\n\u201cThe consumer organizations and their associates want ABS on scooters because they are convinced it will bring them safety benefits, but it looks like that plays into the hands of Bosch,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cIn our view, the real safety benefit for scooters is combined braking system.

Plaintiff is apparently without his legal property due his recent transfer and requests that the Court provide him with a copy of his original complaint. In light of the fact that Plaintiff was recently transferred from Coalinga State Hospital to the Fresno County jail and is without his legal property and Plaintiff's original complaint is not voluminous, the Court will make a one-time exception and provide Plaintiff with a free copy of his original complaint. However, Plaintiff is advised and cautioned that he is responsible for retaining any and all documentation related to this case. The Clerk of Court does not ordinarily provide free copies of case documents to parties. The Clerk charges $.50 per page for copies of documents. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914(a). Copies of up to twenty pages may be made by the Clerk's Office at this Court upon written request and prepayment of the copy fees. The fact that the Court has granted leave for Plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis does not entitle him to free copies of documents from the Court.

I had no control over who I lived with. They were all men, all straight, and all rather macho. Most had drinking problems. There was only person who I\u2019d yet told, and he\u2019d reacted\u2026 interestingly (He was okay with it, but in a horribly patronizing and sexist way, and asked if he could feel my breasts. Seriously).\nThis roommate was named Chris. He was young and kind of hipster-ish in a really shallow way, made his living off of theft and scamming the Ministry Of Housing And Social Development, was one of the most manipulative people I\u2019ve ever known, and drank a lot.\nThere was also an older roommate named James. James was a waiter at a fancy restaurant, had some pretty serious emotional issues, and also was a terrible alcoholic (as well as having a pretty huge weed habit, too). He was emphatically pro-life, extremely misogynistic, highly opinionated and domineering, and still very, very angry at an ex-girlfriend who\u2019d aborted the child they\u2019d conceived together twenty years ago.\nI was a bit nervous about how the fuck I was going to come out to everyone and what their reactions would be, but my efforts to move out had failed miserably and I was broke. I was starting to look pretty feminine and was already experiencing male-fail (where someone in an MtF transition gets gendered female despite presenting as male). I intended to go full-time within a month or two, and just couldn\u2019t keep it secret forever.\nThat afternoon, Chris invited over his pot dealer, Dave or something, to make a big sale to James. The two of them invited me out to the back porch to share a joint. I figured sure, what the heck, why not? I don\u2019t smoke very often, but I accept it when offered. After smoking, Chris, who was sitting next to me, looked over at me and started discretely asking some trans-related questions. I indicated I wasn\u2019t comfortable talking about any of that with James and Dave sitting right there. Chris indicated I should stop worrying and tell them. I said I wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. Chris said he\u2019d do it then. I told him not to. He said he was going to anyway. I begged him not to.\nChris looks over at James and Dave .\u201cSo I have this friend back in Calgary\u2026\u201d, he began.

It creeps me out.\u201d\nI could feel my cheeks flushing with blood and heat. I knew there was absolutely no way I wasn\u2019t going to tip myself off through body language alone, so I bolted, making up an excuse about munchies, and headed off for a quick walk.\nWhen I got back, conversation halted, Chris wore a smirk, and Dave and James stared at me in bewilderment, morbid curiosity, fear and disgust. That was a look that, like my father\u2019s, I would come to know pretty well. I knew within seconds what had happened. The moment after I left, Chris had revealed the identity of his \u201cfriend in Calgary\u201d. He\u2019d outed me.\nI hid in my room for the duration of the afternoon, finally leaving in the evening when things were quiet and Dave had long since left to go grab some food from the 7/11 up the street. At the time, I was wearing a Henley t-shirt, a women\u2019s (but unisex-enough) cropped leather jacket, girl jeans, and a pair of yellow Converse low-tops.\nI grabbed a coke, a cup of frosted flakes and a Coffee Crisp and got in line. I stood in front of a really dodgy looking shaved-head white-urban-creep type dude in a really baggy camo jacket. After a few moments of standing there quietly, I heard him say, \u201cDamn dude! Those are some UGLY fucking shoes!\u201d\nI just looked back, and gave a shrug and half-smile, not wanting to turn it into a confrontation.\nA moment passed.\n\u201cI mean, really, those are like the UGLIEST fucking shoes I\u2019ve ever seen!

I don\u2019t want any pussy faggots like you for friends.\u201d\nI turned away. I paid. I began walking home.\nSo this is how things were going to be from now on. I was openly hated. I was an acceptable target. A pussy faggot bitch. Mentally unbalanced and ought to be placed in a psychiatric hospital.

Just sitting there. A few feet outside my front door.\nIt was a My Little Pony. The kind they made back in the eighties when I was a kid. The kind I\u2019d always wanted. And it was just sitting there on the sidewalk, waiting for me. Like a little message just for me.\nA message that said no matter how many awful people there are in this world, or how much hate I was going to have deal with, this whole thing, transition, was still worth it. It was still completely the right choice. Because what it meant, far more than being a target for the scorn of a few idiots, was getting to finally be myself, finally stop suppressing and denying who I was, finally be able to do and be all the things I\u2019d wanted, finally get to live honestly, sincerely, happily, finally not have to compromise myself for the expectations of others, finally get to give myself a life worth living, the life I\u2019d wanted, the life I deserved.

Hundreds, maybe thousands, of riled up bikers from around Europe are gearing up for a massive motorcycle rally outside the European Parliament November 22 in opposition to proposed anti-tampering motorcycle legislation.\nThey\u2019re message is clear: EU, get your hands off our bikes.\nBut still elusive is what the legislation will actually stipulate once it\u2019s up for a vote on December 5 among members of the parliament\u2019s Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee which has been tasked with reshaping the law. The vote was originally scheduled for November 22 (hence the biker protest) but was pushed back in order to have more time for review.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be up in the air until the committee vote, and even then that\u2019s not the final stage,\u201d says Stephane Reynolds, assistant to British MEP Malcom Harbour, chair of the IMCO. \u201cBut the picture becomes clear after the committee vote and before the parliament (plenary) vote.\u201d\nThe original draft was met with fury by European motorcyclists when it was introduced last year. The main contentions among bikers included several key provisions that would apply to motorcycles manufactured after the date of the law\u2019s implementation.\nThose provisions would: prevent riders from modifying their bikes to increase power, torque or speed outside the standards set by the manufacturer or defined by the vehicle\u2019s category; require bikes to come with anti-lock brake systems; require on board diagnostic equipment to warn of potential malfunctions, and; require bikes to come with automatic headlight-on. The main argument in favor of the law is to improve road safety and emissions control.\nSo, what\u2019s the problem?\nFor many motorcyclists, their bikes represent their livelihoods. They see the legislation as an attempt by the EU to take away their hobby to modify bikes and restrict their freedoms on the road.\n\u201cMotorcycles are a big part of our culture in the UK,\u201d says British MEP Marta Andreasen who has come out in firm opposition to the law. \u201cThis legislation has no value, it will just hurt our community.\u201d\nAndreasen has even drafted a petition that would force Parliament to debate the legislation should it collect 100,000 signatures, although the petition is still far from reaching that target.\nThere is also the question of how the law would affect small businesses that produce after market parts for specific models. If anti-tampering becomes a reality, those businesses would likely be limited to manufacturing parts for older models.\n\u201cI find this unfair,\u201dAndreasen adds. \u201cI suspect it\u2019s the result of lobbying by big companies like Bosch (which produces ABS) which would profit from this legislation.\u201d\nFor mo", "What motivated the author to buy a sailboat at the age of 15", "What significant achievement involving a man-made object is described in the text segment", "What was the outcome of Gregory Ell Shehee's motion for reconsideration submitted to the court on April 10, 2015", "What type of memories does the narrator associate with the Laura Ashley fabric", "know your time is valuable.

The next-best data come from a flash known as XRF 020427, detected in April 2002 by the Italian BeppoSAX satellite. Three characteristics of both flashes conflict with a popular theory that X-ray flashes are gamma-ray bursts as viewed from slightly off to the side of the jet instead of head on.\nFirst, according to the popular theory, scientists expected the energy levels of an X-ray flash's afterglow to connect smoothly on a gradient with the energy of the burst itself. Second, they expected the afterglow to fade fast. And third, they expected the afterglow to be faint when compared to the original burst.\nThese expectations all follow from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, but none of them have panned out. Scientists apparently cannot rely on special relativity to explain X-ray flashes, Lamb said.\nThe satellite observations also conflict with the theory that the shape of the jets from a gamma-ray burst are universal, but only look different because of the viewing angle. Based on this theory, scientists would have predicted that the afterglow of the Feb. 15 X-ray flash afterglow would have faded within a day or so following the initial burst. But the afterglow showed now signs of fading even five days following the burst.\nOne theory suggests that all three types of explosions contain the same amount of energy, but that the opening angle of the jet emitted from the explosions defines their apparent brightness.\nIn this scenario, narrow jets produce the gamma-ray bursts, wider jets result in X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts, and the broadest lead to X-ray flashes. Lamb and many others view this theory as a possibility. \"There's a lot of people who don't or are not at all sure,\" he said.\nThe question could probably be settled within the next few years with more burst observations conducted jointly between the Swift and HETE-2 satellites, which measure slightly different properties of the phenomena. But NASA plans to discontinue the HETE-2 mission this September.\nNASA would somehow need to find an additional $1.5 million annually to keep HETE-2 operating. \"It's not the best budgetary climate to try to pull this thing off,\" Lamb said. But if NASA somehow manages to do it, \"The HETE mission would leverage the science that Swift could do by a significant amount,\" he said.\n// end //", "What are the qualifications of Merriam-Webster as a provider of language information", "ents learn about in high school.

In this article, we take a look at low competition niches in 2020. But is there such a thing as a low competition niches?\nThe thing is no matter what you think of, there are people who have thought of that idea before you and they have probably built a website on it. Take woodwork, for example, this was one of the less competitive niches a few years ago, but now there are so many woodwork blogs and YouTube channels.\nShould that stop you from starting a woodwork blog? Definitely not. What some people miss understanding is that your way of presenting things is not the same as the other person\u2019s, for example, I am running a make money online website here.\nHow Many Make Money Websites Are Out There?\nThere are so many make money online websites and YouTube channels, did that stop me from starting this website? Nope, even though I knew it\u2019s not gonna be easy, I still went for it because I had tips to share and I had a passion.\nSure, my website is not as fancy or as big as that one of Neal Patel but hey I have my own little platform here and I can share whatever I feel like sharing.\nAll that being said, there are some less competitive blog niches, that you can venture into and earn an income.\nLet\u2019s Take A Look At These Low Competition Blog Niches\nSecurity System Reviews\nAlthough there are websites that are reviewing security systems, this niche is not as competitive as let\u2019s say the make money online, or fitness/weight loss.\nWithin this niche, there are many products that you can promote, and you can even find lots of products on Amazon, which makes sales easier.\nGaming, Are people Making Fun of You For Playing Video Games?\nIf you have read my about how Children became the highest earners on YouTube, then you know that the gaming community was among the top ten YouTube earners, earning millions of dollars, this is a huge niche and it\u2019s still not taken seriously.\nSo if you like internet games, then you can create your own blog, and even a YouTube channel and get a piece of this huge pie.\nOK, when I say dancing, I am not talking about any kind of dancing, I am referring to pole dancing, this is a niche that is almost untouched. If you create a nice blog where you share all kinds of tips and product reviews, you will be able to earn a good income from this niche.\nYou will be able to find a bunch of products to promote in this niche from sites like ClickBank, ShareASale and even amazon, you can promote shoes, outfits, makeup and lots of other things that involve this kind of dancing, just try to make your articles as clean and professional as possible.\nYou can also do reviews of training centers and ask them for a coupon code and an affiliate link, so you can earn a commission when someone signs up as a result of reading your review.\nGreen Energy, Help Our Planet And Earn At The Same Time\nOK, so we all know that our planet needs some TLC or we are all gonna perish. This niche is one that could be very lucrative, and you will also help our planet by running such a site and recommending products like solar-powered lamps, solar panels, etc\nAnd while we are in the subject of environment and planet, let\u2019s talk Eco-friendly products, this is another niche that you could actually incorporate into your Renewable energy site as a category and grow your website that way.\nOr you can choose it as a niche on its own.\nCBD For Pets\nThe world has gone CBD crazy and even though there are many CBD websites, the CBD for pets niche it\u2019s still less competitive and if you are into the whole CBD thing, then you can create a very successful website in this niche.\nMost people these days are going for LED lights, so your job as a blogger will be to create a website where people can learn about the best-LED lights, lamps, etc\nSo I bet you are wondering how you can build a military niche website/blog, believe it or not, this is a niche that can bring you some really good income.\nIf you have a military background, you can start a blog, where you share content that caters to military families, you can cover topics like life in the military, the transition process from military to civilian, etc\nWe are living in times when people have somehow become very spiritual, not necessarily religious, but spiritual, we have people who believe in the rule of attraction, that is the thing on YouTube and Pinterest, it\u2019s all about manifestation, and attracting the things you want in your life.\nI still don\u2019t know how that whole power of attraction and manifestation works, I was recently watching a lady on YouTube who claimed to have manifested $100,000, I would love to learn to d"]}
