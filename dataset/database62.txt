For single patient use only. Do not reuse, reprocess, or resterilize. Reuse, reprocessing, or resterilization may compromise the structural integrity of the device and/or lead to device failure which, in turn, may result in patient injury, illness, or death. Always have external defibrillation equipment available during implant and electrophysiologic testing. Using multiple pulse generators could cause pulse generator interaction, resulting in patient injury or a lack of therapy delivery. In response to applicable nonrecoverable or repeat fault conditions, the pulse generator will switch irreversibly to Safety Core operation. Safety Core pacing may be unipolar, which may interact with an ICD. Safety Core behavior is affected by MRI Protection Mode. Do not kink, twist, or braid the lead with other leads as doing so could cause lead insulation abrasion damage or conductor damage. For leads that require the use of a Connector Tool, use caution handling the lead terminal when the Connector Tool is not present on the lead. Do not contact any other portion of the IS4\u2013LLLL lead terminal, other than the terminal pin, even when the lead cap is in place. Do not use atrial tracking modes in patients with chronic refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias. Do not use atrial-only modes in patients with heart failure. Lead Safety Switch should be programmed Off for patients with an ICD. Unipolar pacing due to Lead Safety Switch is contraindicated for patients with an ICD. Automatic Lead Recognition should be programmed to Off before implant with patients with an ICD. Unipolar pacing due to RAAT is contraindicated and should be programmed off for patients with an ICD. Left ventricular lead dislodgement to a position near the atria can result in atrial oversensing and left ventricular pacing inhibition.

Lord Abbett, an investment firm located just outside New York City, was looking for a food stylist to create a gingerbread replica of their office building to both be featured in their holiday greeting video and live in the lobby of the building for the holiday season. There were two major challenges for this project. First, the building has a huge amount of glass on the facade, which required some structural engineering. I also had to figure out a way to bake all the pieces in my tiny Brooklyn oven and piece it together like a puzzle.\nIf someone had told me when I was a kid that one day I would get to make gingerbread houses for a living, I never would have believed I'd be so lucky.

What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand\n\u2014-The aforementioned eminently quotable Mr. Gravy\nReports vary as to exactly how many people were actually at Woodstock. Most estimates put it at somewhere between 4- 500,000. One official in New York \u2013 who did an aerial survey \u2013 swears it\u2019s closer to 700,000. It was impossible, he said, to count all the people under the trees. Regardless, it was \u2013 even if only temporarily \u2013 the third largest city in New York State.\nAnd given the fact that they barely had enough food and medical supplies for the 200,000 people they expected, the organizers approached the New York State Police to have the place declared a disaster area.\nAt first, Governor Nelson Rockefeller wanted to send in the National Guard to break the festival up. (Rockefeller was a total hard-ass and \u2013 outside of Richard Milhous Nixon \u2013 perhaps the most \u201cun-Woodstock\u201d person on earth.) The organizers convinced Rockefeller that this would only serve to provoke a confrontation with the National Guard. The disaster declaration was made.\nSo not only was a confrontation with the National Guard avoided, but in fact a local Air Force Base helped keep order and airlifted performers to and from the concert. Even Abbie Hoffman, about as radical and anti-war a guy as you could find, couldn\u2019t help but comment on how helpful the military were:\n\u201cThe people flying the helicopters were, of course, National Guard. And they were ready to go to Vietnam\u2026. And here we were, the antithesis. But when it came to things like saving lives and getting out good information\u2026.. the casual sex and \u2026 the fact we were against the war didn\u2019t matter.

Carlos, perhaps to this day the performer most in tune with Woodstock values, later said:\n\u201cAt Woodstock I saw a collective adventure representing something that still holds true today.

As they were doing a blues, some guy from the audience jumped up and started hugging singer Bob Hite. Instead of security coming in and getting rid of him \u2013 or Hite doing a Townshend \u2013 he just let the guy hang out and even lit his cigarette with his lighter.\nDespite the folky-countryish sound of \u201cGoing up the Country,\u201d Canned Heat actually were a blues band who in their zeal for the genre, gave themselves nicknames like \u201cBear\u201d and \u201cBlind Owl.\u201d But I think this song captures the feel of some of what was going on at Woodstock as well as anything:\nSly and the Family Stone absolutely killed at this show.

The clip here is only a small portion of what they did but it\u2019s still pretty great.\nReports are that Janis Joplin and Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane were dancing together to Sly.

Bound in three-quarter leather, the 1858 atlas contains 31 lithographed maps with hand coloring. It is a handsome atlas, with the middle of each double-page spread occupied by a map of a specific state or territory, surrounded by statistical and historical information about the region, including Native American tribes and the American/Mexican borderlands.\nThe general map of the country is one of the finest Mexican maps created in the 19th century, with a Mexican eagle perched on a cactus at top center, and beautiful lithographed views of Mexican landmarks. The atlas sold for $13,000.\nJuly's second most expensive sale on AbeBooks was a limited edition 2003 Spanish reprint of Don Quixote illustrated by Salvador Dali. The surreal artist made many drawings of this legendary character, and this was not the only edition of Cervantes\u2019 classic that Dali illustrated. Pictured here (left) is an Argentinian edition published in Buenos Aires 1957-58, and preceding that was an English edition from Random House in 1946.\nOther notable sales on the list included a first edition, first printing four-volume set of Winston S.

Churchill used History of the English Speaking Peoples to reinforce his strong relationship with America. Churchill included S, for Spencer, in his name on his books to differentiate himself from an American author also called Winston Churchill.\nAnother significant sale was Heart\u2019s Desire by Chrysilla Von Dansdorf for $6,500. It was published by Golden Cockerel Press in 1939. The Golden Cockerel Press was a famous private press that published handmade books of stunning beauty from 1920 to 1961.

Buenos Aires, located on the western shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary flowing into the Atlantic Ocean, opposite the Portuguese outpost of Colonia del Sacramento, was chosen as the capital. Usually considered one of the late Bourbon Reforms, the organization of this viceroyalty was motivated on both commercial grounds (Buenos Aires was by then a major spot for illegal trade), as well as on security concerns brought about by the growing interest of competing foreign powers in the area. The Spanish Crown wanted to protect its territory against Great Britain and the Kingdom of Portugal.\nBut these Enlightenment reforms proved counterproductive, or perhaps too late, to quell the colonies' demands. The entire history of this Viceroyalty was marked by growing domestic unrest and political instability. Between 1780 and 1782, the Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II inspired a violent Aymara-led revolt across the Upper Peru highlands, demonstrating the great resentment against colonial authorities by both the mestizo and indigenous populations. Twenty-five years later, the Criollos, native-born people of the colony, successfully defended against two successive British attempts to conquer Buenos Aires and Montevideo. This enhanced their sense of autonomy and power at a time when Spanish troops were unable to help.\nIn 1809, the Criollo elite revolted against colonial authorities at La Paz and Chuquisaca, establishing revolutionary governments, juntas. Although short-lived, these provided a theoretical basis for the legitimacy of the locally based governments, which proved decisive at the 1810 May Revolution events deposing Viceroy Cisneros at Buenos Aires.\nThe revolution spread across the Viceroyalty, except for Paraguay (which declared itself an independent nation in 1811) and Upper Peru (which remained controlled by royalist troops from Lima, and was eventually re-incorporated into the Viceroyalty of Peru). Meanwhile, the Governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo, appointed as a new Viceroy by the Cortes of C\u00e1diz in 1811, declared the Buenos Aires Junta seditious. However, after being defeated at Las Piedras, he retained control only of Colonia del Sacramento and Montevideo. He departed by ship to Spain on 18 November and resigned as Viceroy in January 1812. By 1814, as the revolutionary patriots entered Montevideo, following a two-year-long siege, the Viceroyalty was finished as government of the region.\nOrigin and creation\nIn 1680, Manuel Lobo, Portuguese governor of Rio de Janeiro, created the Department of Colonia and founded Col\u00f3nia do Sacramento. The fort was located on the coast of present-day Uruguay and developed as the department's capital. Lobo's chief objective was to secure the Portuguese expansion of Brazil beyond the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which had defined areas of influence in the Americas between the Iberian nations. From 1580 to 1640, Spain had controlled Portugal and thus all of its territories in America. In 1681 Jos\u00e9 de Garro quickly attacked and seized the new fort for Spain. On 7 May 1681, under the Provisional Treaty of Lisbon, it was ceded to Portugal.\nThe Viceroyalty of Peru was requiring all commerce to go through the port of Lima, on the Pacific Ocean. This policy failed to develop the potential of Buenos Aires as an Atlantic port, adding months to the transport of goods and commodities in each direction. It resulted in encouraging widespread contraband activities in the eastern region, especially in Asunci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires and Montevideo.\nUnder these conditions, Viceroy Manuel de Amat y Junyent issued a decree for the former Governor of the R\u00edo de la Plata Pedro Antonio de Cevallos to found the new viceroyalty in August 1776. The ruling was resisted by the elite of Lima, but it was enforced. The Cabildo of the Captaincy General of Chile requested the King be excluded from the new viceroyalty, which was accepted. The Cuyo region, with its main city Mendoza, was split from the Captaincy General of Chile. Leaders in Santiago resented this action as the Cuyo region had been originally settled by Spanish colonists from Chile.\nThe Portuguese prime minister Marquis of Pombal encouraged the occupation of territory which had already been awarded to the Spanish in the Treaty of Paris (1763), following the British defeat of France in the Seven Years' War. King Charles III quickly reacted to the advantageous conditions: France was bound to be an ally as a guarantor of the treaty, and Great Britain, due to its own colonial problems with revolution in the Thirteen Colonies in North America, maintained neutrality on the issues between Portugal and Spain.\nPedro de Cevallos conquered Colonia del Sacramento and the Santa Catarina islands after a siege of three days, gaining the First Treaty of San Ildefonso. With it, the Portuguese retired from the R\u00edo de la Plata and left the Banda Oriental for Spain. In exchange Spain ceded them the area of Rio Grande do Sul, which they developed as Brazil. Cevallos ended his military actions at this point and started working with government, but he was soon replaced by Juan Jos\u00e9 Vertiz y Salcedo. The viceroyalty was tasked with promoting local production of linen and hemp as export commodity crops, to supply the Spanish cloth industries that the Bourbons sought to favor.\nThe early viceroyalty\nThe conditions imposed by Spain on local commerce were high, but Charles III sought to lighten the burden. He allowed commerce through Buenos Aires on Spanish flag ships that were manned with Spanish naval officers. The ports of Buenos Aires and Montevideo were included in a list of Spanish ports allowed to trade with each other, certain Spanish American products were imported tax-free to Spain, and all the cities with ports were to be assigned Consulates or Tribunals of Commerce. This was not free trade, but a predecessor to what would develop.\nIn the decade of 1778\u20131788, the commerce between Spain and Spanish America increased by nearly 700%. Buenos Aires was given a customs office in 1778, and Montevideo in 1789. Spanish policy still was directed at restricting Argentina commerce; the Empire banned the export of silver from Buenos Aires and tried to direct exports out of Potos\u00ed.\nThe system of corregimientos to mark the subdivisions of the territory was ended in 1782, and replaced with Intendencias by Charles III. The new system was intended to re-enforce the royal authority and promote centralization. Buenos Aires had the main intendencia, and the other cities provincial ones. In 1778 Cevallos reinstated the Real Audiencia of Buenos Aires, by creating a new one; he maintained the Real Audiencia at Cochabamba. The Consulate of Commerce of Buenos Aires was authorized that year, but legal difficulties prevented its being established until 1794.\nIn 1766, Spain acquired the French colony on the Falkland Islands,", "their outstanding commitment to PROJECT ANGEL FOOD.

The shoot consisted of both still photos and video sequences, which was a recipe for long hours and multiple takes. The client was looking for food that felt elevated and elegant, and the talent had to interact with it in a way that felt natural. As a food stylist it is always challenging to create an environment that feels like the best version of real life, especially when the camera is constantly moving and the actors are (appearing to be) eating it... sometimes for 4 or 5 hours at a time!

The model is able to reproduce the experimental \u00b9H MAS NMR spectra for all hydrations and temperatures studied. For the first time, definitive spectral assignments for all hydroxyl and water protons in the sample has been achieved. Spectral features arising due to temperature change have been explained by using the known result that the proton chemical shift of a hydrogen atom involved in hydrogen bonding varies linearly with temperature. Furthermore, it is reported for the first time, that with increasing hydration, water molecules begin to favour forming two hydrogen bonds to the surface. This may represent the first step in the pore filling process", "e kept losing Andy\u2019s socks and underwear!\nWe did several loads of laundry during our time there, basically washing everything that we could since we weren\u2019t paying by the pound like we had been previously. I set the washer to do a long load which turned out to take 2.5 hours. The soap never fully washed out on the first wash so we did a quick wash afterwards which took another hour or so. While this seemed a little excessive, when the clothes came out they looked brand new. Pieces of clothing that we had just about given up on and were considering throwing out are back into the regular rotation in our wardrobe.\nThere was a drying rack in the apartment but we don\u2019t prefer the feel of air dried clothes and opted to use the dryers that were in the building. For only 17R or $1 per load we were able to dry a load of laundry.\nEven though the kitchen wasn\u2019t very large, we absolutely loved having it. There were great grocery stores in Cape Town with tons of really good, inexpensive produce, something that we had not seen in Latin America and we were dying to eat. We cooked in more than we had thought we would, but were able to make some pretty great meals.\nThere was no traditional oven in the apartment, just a halogen oven which looked a little complex for us to figure out. Our biggest complaint was that the kitchen island was on wheels which did not lock. A couple of times during our stay we had to move the island back into place since it slowly kept moving further and further away.\nThe building had 24 hour security guards which was nice from a safety perspective but a little annoying for us. Since we weren\u2019t residents and the owner of the apartment isn\u2019t supposed to lease out the apartment for short term rentals, we had to explain that we were \u201cstaying with a friend\u201d whenever we returned to the apartment. After each guard heard our story we didn\u2019t have to explain it again, but there were quite a few different guards that worked in the building.\nLike the building, our apartment itself was also very secure. In addition to our front door which had a deadbolt there was also a locked gate as well.\nOur wifi at the apartment was not a traditional setup. We had a hotspot which was both good and bad.\nIt was good since we could take the hotspot with us around town and have wifi wherever we went. It was bad since the host had to pay by the amount of data used. We normally would have loaded all of our pictures to our Google drive but felt awkward about using that much data.\nThe location of our apartment was perfect. We were close to Long Street which is where all of the backpackers typically stay, not too far from Kloof Street, a nice area with lots of shops/restaurants and a 20 minute walk from the waterfront. It was easy to get wherever we needed to go pretty much by foot. The only time that we had to use the MyCiTi bus is when we headed up to Lion\u2019s Head Mountain to hike one evening.\nThe neighborhood always felt safe and although there was some noise outside of our window, we expected that being in a centrally located part of town.\nWe had a really great time at our apartment in Cape Town and I believe it was part of the reason that we had such a great time in the city. We had our own space which was clean and comfortable, were centrally located and felt very secure.\nWhen we return to Cape Town, which we have plans to at some point, we will probably stay in the same part of town and possibly even the same apartment", "China has declared ICOs and cryptocurrencies illegal, but this has not created problems for the inauguration of a few days ago of the ETH Hotel located in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Aba, in the central-northwestern part of China.\nAccording to the Twitter account cnLedger, a serial Chinese promoter of crypto-news that resists the bans, the ETH Hotel is challenging the ban on cryptocurrency imposed by the Chinese government and is apparently also accepting ETHs as a method of payment.\nSome new photos of the \u201cETH Hotel\u201d, China\u2019s first hotel to accept $ETH payment.

Tan\nThe minutes of the meeting of February 1st were reviewed and approved as amended.\nThe policy on inactivating infrequently offered courses was discussed. The rationale behind this policy change is that departments are reluctant to inactivate courses that have not been offered for a while when asked on a yearly basis. Reluctance is due to not wanting to go through the process of re-proposing, reactivation, etc. The new policy that was approved by the Undergraduate Council is as follows:\nThis new policy is expected to eliminate approximately one quarter of the courses that students currently see on line.\nSome of the following suggestions were offered to assist students in planning their schedules \u2013 making history of course offerings available to students in the Bulletin or on PeopleSoft, making available to students when departments anticipate offering courses next, suggest students contact departments for course offering information, etc.\nKane introduced a discussion to eliminate the distinction between \u201ccombined\u201d and \u201csequential\u201d 5-year programs. The suggested title would be \u201cAccelerated Programs\u201d. It was not clear what impact this would have on the current sequential programs. Kane was asked to draft information on the proposed accelerated programs and the topic will be revisited at our next meeting. Kane was asked what the rationale for the change was and what the graduate school input was since the sequential programs are currently graduate programs.\nPolicy for infrequently offered courses\nWhen asked (yearly) departments are reluctant to inactivate courses that have not been offered for a while.

Since we had a great time staying in apartments for other parts of our stay, we decided that we would explore that option. It\u2019s typically cheaper, so we began looking at Airbnb.\nAfter a little bit of research we stumbled upon a really cute looking studio apartment. The price was right at only $30 a day and the fact that there was a kitchen would allow us to further keep our costs down. We decided to book it and a short while later, our request was accepted.\nThroughout the time between when we booked the apartment and when we arrived, we were in contact with our host Lara who was extremely responsive. She let us know that she was not in town but her friend Matt would let us in. We agreed that I would send Matt a Whatsapp when we landed at the airport and we would meet at the apartment.\nSince we don\u2019t have data on our cellphones, we have to rely on wifi to use Whatsapp. While this is annoying, it is necessary since an international data plan would have been prohibitively expensive for long term travel. I assumed that there would be wifi at the Cape Town airport but was not able to connect to the extremely weak signal that I found. We figured that we would hop in a cab and figure out how to get in touch with Matt when we arrived.\nWhen we arrived the guy at the front desk said it was an office building, not an apartment building. He said that many times people come there incorrectly and there are some scammers that use their address. I was worried for a few seconds then realized that Airbnb would refund my money fully and suspend the account if the person was listing an apartment which does not exist.\nWe popped over to a restaurant to connect to wifi where we were able to get in touch with our host. Turns out our apartment was next door to where we arrived. Our host contacted Matt and told us that he would arrive shortly. Her idea of shortly was a little different than ours since we had to wait for 30 minutes for him to show up. Once he arrived we got the run down of the apartment and were left the keys.\nWe were happy when the apartment doors opened that the place was clean and well decorated. It was a studio apartment so our bedroom was not separated from the rest of the apartment by a wall, but it was tucked away in a corner which made it feel more like a proper bedroom.\nWhen I booked the apartment I did not notice that there was no air conditioning. Normally this would be less of an issue, but when we arrived in Cape Town there was a heat wave and drought caused by El Nino. This made getting sleep a little bit challenging, especially since there was no bed sheet, only a comforter within a duvet which was quite hot. Fortunately the bed and pillows were comfortable which helped us sleep better than we expected.\nThe bathroom was good, clean and functional. The shower had good water pressure and the water was always hot, our only complaint was that there was no shower curtain or door at the front of the shower. This always got the floor a little bit wet which was a little strange and required us to hang up the rug to dry after our showers.\nBy far our favorite perk was having our own washing machine in the apartment. While I know a lot of people would love to have their clothes sent out to be washed, we always found that our clothes were never as clean at home, the prices are quite high and everyon", "l be a deciding factor, too.

Applicants must have completed a minimum of 60 credits of course work, with a g.p.a. of 3.00 or higher in all college work. The application must include approval by both the chairperson of the department offering the bachelor\u2019s degree and the graduate studies director of the program offering the master\u2019s degree.\nStudents can double count a maximum of 15 credits of graduate courses toward the undergraduate and graduate portions of the accelerated program.\nAlthough the University allows undergraduate students enrolled in an accelerated program to use a maximum of 15 graduate credits toward the undergraduate portion of the combined degree, the maximum allowance may be less than 15, depending on the specific program. The department requirement in this case supersedes the university standard. Please consult the appropriate department.\nPer state regulation, a student must spend at least one year in full-time residency for the masters portion of the program. Students must earn a minimum of 30 graduate credits for the masters portion of the program.

He and his wife performed Hajj rites in 2010 on their one-year wedding anniversary.\nTraveling alongside millions of people in 100-degree heat on an empty stomach and maybe three hours of sleep is something that every pilgrim must overcome while performing the rites of the Hajj, he said.\nPilgrims also have to control their temperament, remain patient and keep a positive mentality during Hajj. If a pilgrim causes harm or breaks their agreement to keep peace while performing the rites, they will have to come back another year to complete it.\n\"By far it was the hardest thing I've ever done, and I've had four kids and gone through divorce, so I've seen some hard times,\" Ms. Killinger said. \"You're in a great deal of hardship at times and everything might not be to your wishes so you have to rise up to a new level on Hajj.\"\nBefore arriving in Mecca, pilgrims must cleanse themselves and enter into a state of purity known as ihram. Men must change into ihram clothing, which consists of two pieces of white cloth that cover the body, while women can choose a color to wear. Once pilgrims are in a state of ihram, they must not shave, use perfume, cut their hair or nails or have sexual intercourse.\"\n\"You don't show any of your luxuries,\" Imam Saad said. \"You are just in the condition that your lord wants you to be.\"\nPilgrims arriving in Mecca make theirway to the Grand Mosque, where they get a glimpse of a large black cubic stone structure called the Kaaba.

The expulsion of the British settlement in 1770 brought the two countries to the brink of war but a peace treaty allowed the British to return from 1771 until 1776, with neither side relinquishing sovereignty.\nBy the nineteenth century, Buenos Aires was becoming more self-sufficient, producing about 600,000 head of cattle annually (of which about one quarter was consumed locally). The area was rapidly developing. But wars with Great Britain meant a great setback for the region's economy, as maritime communications were practically paralyzed. The Alto Peru region started to show resistance to continued support of the administration and defense of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary; it provided the main support but its silver production at Potos\u00ed was declining. In the first years of the viceroyalty, around 75% of the expenses were covered with revenues from the north. The Alto Plata (mostly present-day Paraguay) also had problems with the Buenos Aires administration, particularly because of its keeping a monopoly on exports.\nThe Napoleonic Wars on the Continent preoccupied the Spanish government and, after its defeat, Napoleon placed his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne. By 1805, Spain had to help France because of their 1795 alliance, and lost its navy to the British in the Battle of Trafalgar. The Spanish prime minister had warned the viceroyalty of the likelihood of a British invasion, saying it could not provide support to the city of Buenos Aires.\nOn 27 June 1806, a small British force of around 1,500 men under Col. William Carr Beresford successfully invaded Buenos Aires. Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte had escaped to C\u00f3rdoba. The British forces were thrown back by the criollos on December 1806, a militia force from Montevideo under the leadership of Santiago de Liniers. In February 1807, British reinforcements of about 8,000 men under Gen. Sir Samuel Auchmuty captured Montevideo after a fierce fight. In May Lt. Gen. John Whitelock arrived to take overall command and attacked Buenos Aires on 5 July 1807. After losing more than half his force, who were killed or captured, Whitelock signed a cease-fire and departed for Great Britain.\nThe local criollos achievements in the face of lack of support from Spain and defeating the forces of a world power added to their confidence and fueled their movement toward independence. As of 1814, Argentina had been self-governed for about four years, and Paraguay had already declared its independence. The viceroyalty was effectively dissolved when the rebel troops entered Montevideo after a two-year-long siege.\nThe Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata was created in 1776 by the Spanish king Charles III of Spain. Although it functioned as a Spanish colony, R\u00edo de la Plata was technically a personal possession of the King of Spain. This allowed both European Spain and its overseas territories to have their own laws and regulations.\n- Intendency (Spanish: Intendencia) of Buenos Aires: cities of Buenos Aires, Corrientes, Santa Fe, Colonia and Carmen de Patagones.\n- Government (Spanish: Gobernaci\u00f3n) of Montevideo: city of Montevideo.\n- Government of Misiones: cities of San Ignacio, Yapey\u00fa and Candelaria.\n- Intendency of Paraguay: city of Asunci\u00f3n\n- Intendency of C\u00f3rdoba: cities of Rio Cuarto, C\u00f3rdoba, La Rioja, San Juan, Mendoza and San Luis\n- Intendency of Salta: cities of Catamarca, Santiago del Estero, Tucum\u00e1n, Salta and Jujuy\n- Government of Chiquitos\n- Intendency of Potos\u00ed: cities of Potos\u00ed and Oruro.\n- Intendency of La Paz: city of La Paz.\n- Intendency of Cochabamba: cities of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.\n- Intendency of Charcas: city of Charcas (modern Sucre).\n- Government of Moxos\nList of viceroys\nThe King of Spain appointed viceroys to govern the Spanish viceroyalties in his name. In the beginning their terms had no fixed duration and could last for life. Later he established fixed terms of 3 to 5 years. Because of the distances between Spain and South America, and with sailing as the chief means of transport, there were long delays between the designation of a viceroy and the viceroy's effectively taking power.

So whilst the Life Path Number describes the direction of your journey through life (AKA your life purpose) the Destiny Number tells you what the journey is going to look like.\nDestiny / Expression Number 11\nIn Numerology, the Destiny or Expression Number 11 is all about healing and higher frequency.\nThe energy of the number 11 is a little bit different from the rest of the 1-9 single-digit system in Numerology, as \u2013 as you may have guessed \u2013 it\u2019s a double-digit Master Number.

They\u2019re perceptive, and may be drawn to mysticism, the esoteric arts, and/or alternative healing modalities. In fact, even if number 11s don\u2019t become official \u201chealers\u201d they often find people are attracted to them, as they seem to exude naturally healing qualities.

Otherwise, working in healing or therapy (both alternative and more allopathic modalities) could be ideal.\nWith the number 2 undertones, working with other people and communities will feel like home.
