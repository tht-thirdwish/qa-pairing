Nobody has time for this \u2018over the head\u2019 bull. Zippers are preferable. Let me explain:\n3- The hospital says all you need to wipe pooey bums is wet cotton balls. They are wrong. Actual wipes\u2026 (believe it or not)\u2026 do a much better job. (Which isn\u2019t difficult, because ironically cotton balls, suck balls)\n4- Okay this is serious. Zip-up swaddles. Genius. Also the reason I am a semi normal person again. Time is money, and NOBODY has time to be making kebabs out of little kicking and punching munchkins at 2am, 4am, 6am, 8am\u2026 need I continue? Once the angel gets used to the zip-up swaddle, they will know it means bed-time and off they go to beautiful dreamland. If they are as brilliant as my kid, they will then sleep for 7 hours. (It\u2019s my blog, I\u2019ll say what I want about my child being the best.)\n5- ALSO SERIOUS. the Haakka milk suction cup. GENIUS. When I am feeding little gorgeousface, I put the suction cup on the other boob. I get up to 90 mils without doing a damn thing. 90mils = one feed = a margarita. Product sold.\nAND HERE \u2026 I SHALL HELP YOU WITH EMOTIONS\u2026\n1- There are going to be times, when you feel fat, ugly, really sticky, angry & alone. When that happens, get out of the nightclub, get a cab, and make your way back to you family\u2026\n\ud83d\ude09 No but seriously. Some days with your baby are going to feel really foreign. Like you are waiting for the real parents to get back, so you can get your babysitting bucks and go to the movies.\nBut like everything, it passes. I promise. Everything is a phase. Even everything your baby does and is, is just a phase. I am already missing my little tiny newborn \u2026 and I haven\u2019t even had time to take my toenail polish off. You will be okay.\n2- Mums dont quit.\nOkay. Yes. I stole this from the movie \u2018Bad Moms\u2019. But it\u2019s true. You don\u2019t get to resign and you wouldn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s our job and it\u2019s never going back up on seek.com. But the good news is. You aren\u2019t the employee\u2026you are the god damn CEO. So if things aren\u2019t working. Change them. Hell, fire some people. Buy a ping pong table.\n3- There is no RIGHT answer.\nMy own supermumma Mother taught me this. When searching relentlessly online about carriers, strollers, carseats, immunisations (sit down Byron Bay I told you once), don\u2019t keep looking for the RIGHT answer. No one is going to tell you, THIS IS THE WAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT. Research is always changing, opinions are always changing, trends are always changing (and unfortunately this last one is the one that drives the Capitalist Mummy Market the most). So don\u2019t think that you have to keep looking until one option is PERFECT. You wont find it. If you protect your kids from polio, you won\u2019t be able to hang out with Alicia Silverstone. It\u2019s just the way it is. It\u2019s a fine balance. (You will however be able to get your kids into schools.)\nSo do your research.\nMake an INFORMED decision.\nThen BACK YOURSELF.\nBe okay with other (frequently voiced) opinions.\nThen back yourself again.\nThen when that\u2019s all done and you\u2019re feeling good, go home, make a smoothie and watch Orange is The New Black with your daughter safely cooing in your arms\u2026 and don\u2019t worry about the affects of screen time (about violent sexual female prison) on a 11 week old.

The 99% need healing, they need repair, they need transformation. The camp was ripe with hostility towards police. My conversations with the occupiers revealed little or any willingness to forgive and seek atonement from the police. Even more horribly, the occupiers seemed content to forget or even ignore the basic lessons our great non-violent leaders left for us. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said the most dangerous thing about violence is its futility. This great leader recognized that fighting violence with violent resistance leads to a continuing cycle of inter-generational trauma and hatred.\nYet many of the occupiers seemed ready for a violent fight-some welcomed it- and many more were unready to forgive.\nAhh, nothing like cracking some skulls in order to feel truly revolutionary.\nThe highlight of the day was a speech and a reading from the Egyptian movement that was followed by a \u201cSolidarity March.\u201d The reading was disturbing to hear because its focus was on the justification for violent resistance.

State of Tennessee, 697 F.2d 121 (6th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1086 (1983).\nApplication of the above standard to the three distinct claims raised by appellants indicates that the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint. First, there was no error in the dismissal of appellants' claim that appellees had conspired to achieve their being falsely charged with a disciplinary infraction. In this regard, the complaint on its face demonstrates that the alleged conspiracy never achieved that end and that appellants were only threatened with a violation of their rights. A mere threat to a person's enjoyment of a protected interest, however, will not give rise to a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. Macko v. Byron, 760 F.2d 95 (6th Cir.1985).\nLikewise, appellants may not recover upon their claim that they were the object of random searches as inmates in a penal institution generally have no privacy interest of sufficient magnitude to implicate fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 527, 529-30 (1981).\nFinally, as to their claim that they were improperly placed in administrative confinement for a period of three days, it must be observed that prison authorities generally are afforded wide deference in their conduct of internal institutional affairs such as the classification of inmates. Accordingly, courts will not interfere in such matters absent a showing that the action complained of was taken in derogation of a state statute, regulation or policy that has created a protectible liberty interest on behalf of the inmates. Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983). Examination of the complaint indicates that appellants did not allege that their placement in administrative segregation was achieved in violation of such a specific liberty interest. Accordingly, appellants failed to state a colorable claim in this regard and the district court properly granted appellees' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.\nTherefore, the motion for appointment of counsel is hereby denied and the district court's final order entered September 19, 1986, is affirmed.

because the topic is difficult to talk about or taboo. (Oh a \u2018mummy blog\u2019! That\u2019s what I should do! I don\u2019t think anyone has done that yet..)\nAnd it\u2019s not because I have come to some deep dark realisations about motherhood that I need to now gracefully divulge and expose.\nIt\u2019s not EVEN because the baby is asleep, I am showered & fed \u2026 and would quite frankly rather take this opportunity to watch Episode 7, Season 2, of Orange Is The New Black. (Although, this is also true.)\nBut it\u2019s actually because \u2026. my brain in moosh. Mash potato pie. Peas and gravy.\nHOWEVER! Bravely, I soldier on. In an effort to not let down my lovely little online community (or to lose my sweet sweet URL)\u2026 I am instead going to lose my affection for perfection and \u2026 just \u2026 roll.\nSo here goes.\nI love my little dumpling daughter. She is adorable and giggly. We got lucky with this one. She has been sleeping through the night for just over a week now (since 9 weeks, read it and weep suckers) and henceforth I feel less like Shrek and more like Michelle McCarthy. Except her name is Melissa. (Just googled it) Moving on.\nOn the overall, Baby Montasarus is easy and breezy. Especially in her nappy. There is quite a lot of frequent flatulence is what I am saying here.\nShe is very smart. She already knows how to smile into an iPhone camera (I know I know, settle down Byron Bay, she lives on a beach in the islands she will be oooookkkaaaay). She has recently taken quite a liking to her right arm. The better of the two obviously.\nI have learnt a lot in the past 11 weeks. As one would hope. Rearing the young is not for the learning procrastinators. There\u2019s nothing like poo your hair to give you motivation.\nI have systems in place. Tricks of the trade. Nappies folded into the lining of my fancy handbag. We have spare clothes hidden in the cracks and corners of things I didn\u2019t even know existed.\nWe have 35 thousand baby blankets. And as previously mentioned, we live in the islands. So this was perhaps a purchasing oversight. Moving on.\nI am drinking again. Hallelujah. I had a big night when baby turned One Month old. To celebrate my 11 month detox. (Did you know technically babies are actually inside you for 10 months\u2026 since you need to FINISH your 9th month to get to your due date?? This was something that FASCINATED me when I was RELISHING my time as a bloated vomit machine)\nAnyway, don\u2019t worry mums, pre-aforementioned-big-night-out I pumped milk for days in prep. I sweated and toiled over the milking machine. And since my baby is a genius, she took to the bottle like teen to a vodka cruiser. She loved it. AND\u2026 she loved coming back to the boob too. (Sorry booooout it) So yes. Now we have another little non-committal, routine rejecter in the family. Wonder. Where. She. Got. It. #freespirit (And Free Spirits for mummy!!! \u2026 except for that I pay for them. Moving on.)\nAll in all, being a mum is better than I ever dreamt. It\u2019s hard. But not like how they make it out to be in the movies. (Unlike everything else \u2026 which is depicted so perfectly.)\nIt\u2019s tiring for sure. One day I was so over it, I threw a chair. I also gently placed my iPhone on the ground and then kicked it lightly, so it was dramatically across the other side of the room, but the screen was protected.\nI understand now why parents say it\u2019s a job. It is. But it doesn\u2019t have to be a boring one.\nThe hours are long but the payment plan is pretty good. Especially if you are like me and steal cash from your baby daddy\u2019s wallet. #hardtruths.\nSo I guess my underlying message is.. GO OUT AND GET PREGNANT!\nHa. Kidding. Most ya\u2019ll are definitely not ready. (Please cease paying $600 weekly rent in Bondi first per favore.)\nBut if you do decide you want a little mini me (of your own.. not a mini-matisse..
