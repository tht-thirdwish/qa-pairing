The author seems to have completly pulled stuff out of this air, and surprisingly it worked for her. When I was reading the description of this book, I didn\u2019t realize how literal the author was about some of it.\nOverall, if the author meant this book to be how I thought it was, This Darkness Mine is a breathtaking thriller leaving you wondering just how insane the main character is. Her sanity is fought over all throughout the book and even at the end the reader is left wondering. If you are looking for a psychological thriller with complex characters, this book might be perfect for you. With surprises at every corner and high stakes, this book is a fast paced page turner perfect for fans. I would recommend this book for mature readers because of the language the author uses and some of the scenes featured, but if you are willing to look past that you will enjoy the book greatly. At the end, this book will leave you questioning who the real antagonist is, something dark and evil, or Sasha herself.\nI hope that you guys enjoyed this review!

Clarke\u2019s \u201cDial \u2018F\u2019 for Frankenstein\u201d (1965), Harry Harrison\u2019s \u201cAt Last, The True Story of Frankenstein\u201d (1965), Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s \u201cFortitude\u201d (1968) (see Haining 1995: 681\u20138, 728\u201334, 697\u2013715). The origins are revisited most spectacularly in Aldiss\u2019 Prometheus Unbound (1974) in which a modern time traveller returns to the scene of creation to meet Mary and the monster.\nIn \u2018The Last Man\u2019 (1826), Shelley confronts utopian ideas of social and political organisation with a natural disaster of global proportions. Set in the twenty-first century and adopting a visionary tone, the novel contains few modern innovations (balloon travel, a republican England). Quickly abandoning the pretence of futurity, it remains \u201cno more than Gothic\u201d (Aldiss 1973: 33). Its enduring impact lies in its representation of global catastrophe: a feminine and devastating plague wipes out humanity and leaves its civilisation in ruins.\nFrankenstein and \u2018The Last Man\u2019 inaugurate \u201ctwo great myths of the industrial age\u201d (Russ 1995: 126). They engage with the effects of economic, political, and scientific change on individual, familial, and social structures. Enmeshed in the uneven development of modernity, in economic shifts to commerce, industrial production, and imperial expansion, in political calls for reform and democracy, in aesthetic notions of free, imaginative individuals, and in scientific innovations rapidly and visibly transforming the conditions of human existence, the novels identify monstrosities in the new: revolutionary mobs are many-headed monsters, industrial workers are hulking brutes, new economic and political structures reduce humanity to slaves or automata. Like Gothic writing, science fiction \u201cdraws its beliefs, its material, its great organising metaphors, its very attitudes, from a culture that could not exist before the industrial revolution, before science became an autonomous activity and a way of looking at the world\u201d (Russ 1995: 10).\nGothic and science fiction are complex and contradictory effects of modernity, bound up in the metaphors and practices with which it transforms the world.\nModernity, in inventing an array of disciplines along with economic, individual, and political liberties is a curiously doubled formation. It is, like Frankenstein, bound up with matters of production and reproduction, concerned with social and industrial developments shaping individuals, making humans, and making monsters at the same time. In this context, Frankenstein\u2019s concern with a split or alienated self provides an appropriate metaphor to negotiate change and innovation.\nDarko Suvin, in charting the relationship between the industrial revolution and Romanticism, further divides the novel between \u201cflawed hybrid of horror tale and philosophical SF\u201d (Suvin 1979: 127). Where Percy Shelley is the \u201cgreat poetic forerunner\u201d of \u201cSF anticipation,\u201d Mary\u2019s novel participates in a \u201cwidespread recoil from Promethean utopianism\u201d (Suvin 1979: 124, 127). Where Frankenstein is located \u201cin the tradition of the Gothic story,\u201d in horror and disgust, his creature is identified as \u201ccompositional core and the real SF novum that lifts Frankenstein above the level of a grippingly mindless Gothic thriller\u201d (Suvin 1979: 129\u2013130).\nThe division is important, if difficult to sustain, in marking out two very different trajectories for fiction. Science fiction, \u201coriented towards humanity\u2019s furthest horizons,\u201d takes its bearings from Romantic idealism and the imagination of human progress (Suvin 1979: 170). William Godwin and Percy Shelley are exemplary figures in this line of flight: the former, a radical and humanist philosopher, imagined the rational perfectibility of social relations. Developments in technology, he optimistically speculated, in relieving want and the material hardships of labour, indicated the capacity of the mind to overcome matter. Similarly idealistic, Percy Shelley allied the benevolent and transformative potential of scientific discovery (his interests in electricity as the \u201cspark of life\u201d appear in Frankenstein) with poetic visions of human freedom.\nRomanticism informs many of the intellectual aspirations and aesthetic attitudes of science fiction. H.G. Wells acknowledged his place \u201cin the tradition of Godwin and Shelley\u201d (Wells 1966: 552). Gernsback wrote of \u201ccharming romance,\u201d \u201cscientific fact,\u201d and \u201cprophetic vision.\u201d Isaac Asimov, in practice and criticism, associates the genre with scientific advancement, human improvement, and rational understanding (see Broderick 1995: 4).\nThe triumph of mind over matter recurs in Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s fiction: in \u2018Childhood\u2019s End\u2019 (1953) scientific progress has the power to save humankind and produce an \u201covermind.\u201d \u201cNaive romanticism\u201d (Priest 1979: 189) or \u201ctranscendental mysticism\u201d (Hollinger 1990: 34), Clarke\u2019s \u201csupermind,\u201d appearing in the immense modern network of electrical, telecommunicational, and satellite relays in \u201cDial \u2018F\u2019 for Frankenstein,\u201d also has malignant potential. Aesthetic attitudes and critical judgments of science fiction also evince Romanticism: opposing the vulgarity and banality of mass consumption, Aldiss is inspired by a \u201clove of art and science\u201d and a \u201crebellion against smug bourgeois society\u201d (see Broderick 1995: 53). For Ursula Le Guin, imagination supplements reason on a journey \u201cleading us to the freedom that is properly human\u201d (see Broderick 1995: 76).\nMarking the boundary that allows science fiction to rise imaginatively to poetic heights or collapse in monstrous dissolution, Frankenstein makes it difficult to sever Romanticism from its darker counterpart. Both are inextricably bound together, one defining the other in a relationship of difference and reversal akin to that of creator and creature. In the novel, science is associated with visionary enthusiasm, wondrous discoveries, and miraculous knowledge (Shelley 1969: 47\u20138). The motivation for reanimation is framed aesthetically: Frankenstein, like Percy Shelley, is poet and experimenter. His project has benevolent and humane aims, idealistically imagining the end of disease and death.\nThough oversized, superhuman in body and strength, the creature is designed to be beautiful: it will be the first of a \u201cnew species\u201d blessing its father-creator (Shelley 1969: 54). Borne on the wings of fantasy the project encounters its limit in horror: Frankenstein trawls through charnel houses and graveyards to steal the \u201csecret of life\u201d from the body of feminised nature. The creator is appalled by his animated handiwork rather than elated by technical achievement: his horror stems from aesthetic revulsion. Frankenstein\u2019s world is overturned, beauty collapsing in horror, heaven becoming hell. His rejection, repeated by the idealised Romantic family that unwittingly educates the monster, defines monstrosity in terms of social and familial exclusion. Outcast, the monster accepts his designated destructive role.\nIdealisations, the novel suggests, readily engender monsters, figures marking the return of excluded material bodies. The two poles of existence are inseparable: imagining life beyond death, Victor\u2019s actions only exacerbate its work. The painful education of the monster occasions some astute observations on an irreparably divided modern humanity: \u201cwas man, indeed, so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?\u201d (Shelley 1969: 119). Humans are doubled creatures, minds and bodies, individualistic and social, noble and base.

This is particularly useful when printing with PLA to allow additional airflow and cooling.\nThe printer spools on the Flashforge only allow the use of filament spools which have a large 2 inch diameter hole while the QIDI can accommodate spools with 1 inch diameter holes and everything above. This means you can use almost any brand of filament such as the smaller and very popular Hatchbox filament.\nWhat Software Does This Printer Come With?\nThe included SD card contains the Makerware Replicator software and Sailfish which converts the printing instructions from Makerware to the language (.x3g) that the 3D printer understands to execute the printing process.\nIt is also possible to use Simplify 3D to create your printing designs if you prefer to use this program.\nHow Do You Switch From The Right Extruder To The Left Extruder?\nYour extruder set up is all programmed within the slicing software that you\u2019re using. When you create your print job, you need to specify which extruder the printer is to use for each section of the model you\u2019re going to print.\nThis includes using different colors. Just make sure that you have the correct colors in the correct extruders as specified in your print design.\nUseful Tips To Get The Most Out Of Your QIDI 3D Printer:\nTry not to leave prints on the build plate to completely cool down as you may find that they can be difficult to remove.\nStore your filament in a sealed bag to avoid contact with moisture.\nWhen printing with PLA, make sure you turn on the turbo fan as the fan switch defaults to the off position. This will avoid stringiness and lack of adhesion in your finished prints.\nIf you\u2019re having some problems with your prints sticking to the build plate especially when using PLA, try putting some glue on the plate first. You could also try using hairspray. Soak a piece of paper towel with hairspray and wipe over the build plate. Allow it to dry before starting your print job. You may need to repeat this after a few prints.\nFor further support and other helpful tips, there\u2019s an excellent support group for the QIDI Tech 1 on Thingiverse. You\u2019ll also find some interesting print files available including accessories you can print for your QIDI printer such as more sophisticated spool holders and glass bed clamps in case you want to add a glass top to your build plate.\n3 months, however support is excellent if you have any problems.\nWhat Customers Are Saying:\nAfter reading hundreds of reviews on this printer we found that 76% of customers were entirely happy with this printer and gave it a rating of 5 out of 5 stars. There were numerous mentions of the excellent customer service provided by QIDI Tech including fast shipping of replacement parts if needed as well as excellent guidance on installing these and extra parts as bonuses.\nMost customers have commented on the quality and sturdiness of the printer itself and also on the level of detail that the printer produces in each print job. In fact one customer was so happy with the quality of the prints that he has started a business using his QIDI 3D printer.\nWe found many reviews from first time 3D printer users and all have been amazed at how easily and quickly they were able to produce quality prints with their QIDI Tech 1.\nA few customers reported that they had the x-axis cable fail after a few prints. Fortunately there is a spare cable included with the printer and a youtube video available to show you how to replace the cable if needed.\nThe only negative reviews we found were centered around the quality of the sample filament which is included with the printer. As this included filament is only meant for test print jobs, this is definitely not a concern as you will be purchasing your own filament for your 3D print projects.\nThe QIDI Tech 1 Dual Extruder 3D printer is well constructed and very durable. It comes mostly pre-assembled with only a little assembly required before you can start your first print job.\nBeing a fully enclosed printer means that it is much quieter than some other 3D printers and works really well with ABS filament. The acrylic sides not only allow you to better view the printing process but are removable which is highly recommended if you\u2019re using PLA filament.\nThe build plate is easily calibrated and heated to ensure good adhesion of your print job as long as you make sure that the plate is heated to the correct temperature before starting the print.\nThe dual extruders allow you to print in more than one color and also make it easy when you\u2019re using support structures for your print.\nThis 3D printer is an excellent choice if you\u2019re new to 3D printing but also great if you\u2019re looking for an additional printer to add to your collection.

Well, duh.\nBut cigarettes are about to get a whole lot dearer, and many nicotine junkies may not fully grasp what an enormous sum of money is going up in smoke.\nWe'll leave the preaching about quitting for the whanau to the health campaigners.\nThis is all about the money - and it's a compelling enough reason to quit, all by itself.\nWhen you buy a pack of smokes, most of the purchase price goes to the Government through an excise tax.\nThe purpose of the tax is to try and put people off smoking, as well as to collect revenue. Incidentally, far more than smokers actually cost the health system.\nThis month, the excise tax went up another 10 per cent, and that's not the end of it.\nThere are another two 10 per cent hikes planned, which means that in 2016, a pack of 20 cigarettes will cost at least $20.\nWhatever you think of the Government's social engineering, the end result has quite a nice symmetry to it. Each little cylinder of death you suck down is the equivalent of a shiny gold coin.\nThe standard money calculations used by health campaigners only take into account the upfront cost of cigarettes.\nBut that's just the start of it.\nImagine what productive uses you could have put all the cash you've spent on cigarettes over the years. Economists call this the opportunity cost.\nWhat if all those dollar coins were being funnelled into savings and investments, rather than sucked into your lungs in a cloud of poison?\nWe'll use an interest rate of 5 per cent for our scenario, which is a reasonable after tax-return for a diversified portfolio of shares.\nFor simplicity we'll run the numbers for a diehard, pack-a-day smoker. $20 a day is $140 a week, $600 a month and $7200 a year.\nNow we introduce the magic of compounding interest. It starts off slowly. In the first year, compounding monthly, you would have earned an extra $200 on top of the up-front cash savings.\nBy the 10th year, you'd be earning a staggering $4400 worth of extra income each and every year simply by giving ciggies the flick.\nAfter 20 years, you'd have a tidy quarter of a million bucks saved, almost half of which would be investment returns.\nDebt repayment works the same way, except in reverse.\nLet's say you have a chunky mortgage. Every dollar you put towards repaying it gives you a return equivalent to whatever the interest rate is, tax-free.\nYou're compounding the balance downward, instead of up.\nWhile mortgage rates are currently coming off historic lows, long-term data suggests you could expect to pay an average of about 8 per cent over a 20-year period.\nWith our adjusted interest rate, you'd save a whopping $350,000 on your mortgage by channelling all your cigarette money into paying it off.\nEven if you're more of a casual smoker, it's worthwhile. Someone who puffs their way through a measly three ciggies a day would still save $37,000 to $53,000 in our scenarios.\nAnd someone who smoked for even longer than 20 years - a yellow-fingered, tooth-stained life-timer - would stand to save an absolute fortune.\nWith all of that in mind, those who have made a New Year's resolution to give up the fags are definitely on the right track.\nDon't let it become one of the usual feeble goals procl", "uppressant supplements, we used the following ranking factors Appetite is a subjective thing Some people feel hungry all day long Others only feel mild hunger We tested the topranked formulas on our list to rank appetite suppressant supplements and considered reviews.\nhope so!

There are only a few parts that you need to attach before you can start printing.\nHere\u2019s a quick run down of the assembly required:\nWhen you receive your printer box take everything out including the printer itself which is extremely well packed to avoid any damage during transportation.\n1)Attach the extruders into the cradle using the 2 screws provided.\n2)Next attach the 2 filament spool holders to the back of the machine and put the 2 sample filament rolls on to the spools.\n3)Now you need to attach the 2 filament feeder tubes which just clip into the back of the box with snap lock clips to hold them in place.\n4)Feed the filaments through the tubes and insert them into the top of the extruders.\n5)You\u2019ll now want to calibrate the build plate using just a sheet of paper. You\u2019ll find instructions on how to do this in the included manual which is on the SD card. You can also do a test print using the LED panel as a guide.\n6)The next step is to attach the handle and hinges to the acrylic door and then install the door and the acrylic side panels.\n7)Now all that\u2019s left to do is to assemble the acrylic top and install it and you\u2019re ready to start your first print job.\nHere is a youtube video of the unboxing and assembling of the printer:\nHow Does The QIDI Tech 1 Compare To The Flashforge Creator Pro?\nThere are basically three main differences", "How much could a pack-a-day smoker save on their mortgage by quitting smoking and investing their money over 20 years", "What were the main reasons given for people deciding to quit smoking in 2014", "the line in our comedy battle.

In a typical month it would be around 3500,\" she says.\nThis year, the agency is being hit with a double whammy. There's not only the usual rush of resolutioners, but those who are acutely aware of the price hikes.\n\"Interestingly this year we had a lot of people who contacted us between Christmas and New Years ... and they talked about knowing the tax increase was going to come into effect,\" says Woods.\nThe three main catalysts for quitting are health, family and money - with the latter undoubtedly becoming more of a pain point.\nThankfully, it only costs $5 for a subsidised eight-week supply of nicotine gum, and after six months, 25 per cent of those who join the programme have successfully quit.\nIf that sounds low, bear in mind that only 4 to 5 per cent are successful when they go it alone.\nOf course, not every smoker is trapped in an addiction that they want to be rid of.\nThere are plenty of grown adults who are fully aware of the health implications, and make a free decision to smoke for the sheer pleasure of it.\nIf you count yourself among them, there's a way you can have your tobacco and smoke it too.\nTake the example of Southland woman, Liz, who's beating the tax hikes by growing her own.\nFriends and family members have also successfully grown their own baccy - which is reportedly not too bad, especially when mixed with a pouch of commercial stuff.\nSurprisingly, it's totally legal.

The usual advice is to cure the leaf for at least a year - which is not much help if you've got the nicotine jitters right now.\nOnce it's cured, it's a simple matter of chopping it up finely enough to be used.\nWith almost no costs involved, you can still divert all that cash out of the pockets of the Government and big tobacco, and into your own.\nPut that in your pipe and smoke it.\nScotty Darnill's nicotine habit was costing him a fortune.\nStarting from his late teens, the TR Group account manager smoked at least 25 cigarettes a day for the better part of 25 years.\nIn September 2011, he decided to kick the habit once and for all.\nWhile Darnill had tried to quit several times before, this time he went cold turkey and soldiered through, with the help of Quitline's online forums.\nNow there's more money to go around - and more marital harmony - with wife Linda pleased by the decision.\n\"She hated smoking, and she hated the amount of money I was spending on smoking.\"\nDarnill reckons he's already saved about $22,000 since quitting.\n\"Last year, we did another trip to Thailand.

The conjunction of two hybrid genres composed from diverse literary and mythical precursors breeds monstrosities: strange beings and disturbing other \u2014 and underworlds lurk at the limits of modern knowledge.\nDespite so many Gothic science fiction mutations, it is strange the genres should cross at all. Gothic writing conventionally deals in supernatural occurrences and figures, looking back, in its architectural and cultural settings, to superstitious and barbaric \u201cdark\u201d ages without the enlightened reason and empirical technique so important in science fiction\u2019s imaginings of human progress.\nGothic fiction, for all its wanderings in desolate landscapes and invocations of diabolical forces, never strays far from home, playing upon the anxieties of its uncertain present. In looking forward to change, science fiction also projects figures of fear. In the crossings of two generic monsters, monstrosity returns from the past and arrives from the future. As long as it is not \u201cpredictable,\u201d \u201ccalculable,\u201d or \u201cprogrammable,\u201d \u201cthe future is necessarily monstrous\u201d (Derrida 1992: 386).\nGothic fiction begins as a hybrid, a \u201cnew species\u201d of writing combining ancient and modern romance (Walpole 1982: 9). A \u201cstrange monster,\u201d critics considered its plots improbable, its narratives ill-formed and unrealistic, its morality dubious: \u201cmonsters of the imagination\u201d \u2014 a deluge of tales, romances, novels threatening familial and social mores \u2014 propagated only depravity (Williams 1970: 151, 162).\nHybrid, disturbing, monstrous, Gothic fiction developed in the shadow of acceptability. Science fiction, another monster, relishes \u201cits vitalising bastardy, its immoral interdisciplinary habits, as it feathers its nest with scraps of knowledge seized from the limit of the expanding world\u201d (Aldiss 1973: 41).\nDisrespecting disciplines, it disobeys generic divisions to emerge from fantasy, fairy tale, myth, romance, fable, and epic (Aldiss 1973: 8\u201319; Parrinder 1980: 39). It is \u201ca mode of romance with a strong inherent tendency to myth\u201d (Frye 1973: 49). H.G. Wells described his tales as \u201cscientific romances\u201d; Hugo Gernsback (introducing the Amazing Stories magazine in April 1926) defined \u201cscientifiction\u201d as \u201ca charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision\u201d (Ketterer 1974: 50).\nMonstrous in form, romance bred monstrosities: on the one hand, idealised figures, drawn from chivalric or fairy tales, were so impossibly unrealistic as to be \u201cmonsters of perfection\u201d; on the other hand, grotesque and deformed, its characters were \u201cout of nature.\u201d The creations of romance \u201ctransport the reader unprofitably into the clouds, where he is sure to find no solid footing, or into those worlds of fancy, which go forever out of the way of human paths\u201d (Williams 1970: 162).\nRomances idealise and deform, science fiction creates \u201cas many hells as heavens\u201d (Nicholls 1976: 181). Romance reading is unprofitable, failing to offer proper moral instruction: its generic category lies, like science fiction, in the popular and low realms of \u201cparaliterature\u201d (Broderick 1995: vii). In eschewing firm ground in favour of flights of fancy, romances establish the trajectory of science fiction\u2019s unbounded explorations of change, outsiders, escape: its \u201cfreedom of imagery\u201d is freedom from realist conventions.\nIn this respect, science fiction liberally exploits linguistic possibilities, \u201cthe great modern literature of metaphor\u201d (Nicholls 1976: 179\u201382). Metaphor, etymologically, is a form of \u201ctransport,\u201d substituting terms, moving readers to imaginary locations, creating new associations and combinations.\nRaymond Williams, discussing the differences between utopian and science fictional treatments of paradise and hell, altered worlds and willed or technological transformations, observes that \u201cthe presentation of otherness appears to link them, as modes of desire or of warning in which a crucial emphasis is attained by the element of discontinuity from ordinary \u2018realism\u2019\u201d (Williams 1979: 54).\nIn the eighteenth-century, monster metaphors repeatedly served to demonstrate and warn against immorality. Realism and social reality recoils from strangeness and monstrosity. In contrast, science fiction embraces metaphorical possibilities to \u201cdefamiliarise the familiar, and make familiar the new and the strange\u201d (LeFanu 1988: 21). As a \u201cliterature of cognitive estrangement\u201d presenting \u201ca novum,\u201d science fiction depends upon metaphorical creation (Suvin 1979: 4). But the \u201cnovum\u201d is simultaneously a \u201cmonstrum,\u201d the difference a matter of perspective. Strangeness also evokes the \u201cuncanny,\u201d an experience of the disruption of boundaries between reality and fantasy caused by the return of repressed psychic forces or uncertainties surrounding technical and textual mimicry of humans (Freud). In making the familiar strange, the new can be seen as a threat (monstrum) or promise (novum). Part of science fiction\u2019s success stems from the way it has \u201cdiversified the Gothic tale of terror in such a way as to encompass those fears generated by change and technological advances which are the chief agents of change\u201d (Aldiss 1973: 53).\nIn the 1831 introduction to \u2018Frankenstein\u2019, Mary Shelley allows her \u201chideous progeny\u201d to slide from authorial control and \u201cgo forth and prosper\u201d (Shelley 1969: 9). The monster in the text and the monster that is the text (composed of diverse generic fragments, multiple literary and cultural allusions, and different epistolary narratives) complies.\nWhile Frankenstein refuses the monster\u2019s demand for a mate, fearing the birth of a \u201crace of devils,\u201d the culture that receives the novel has no such qualms: in a proliferating host of dramatic adaptations, literary reworkings, cinematic productions and popular citations, Frankenstein and monster are repeatedly invoked as synonyms for acts of uncontrolled experimentation (Easlea 1983; Turney 1998).\nThe novel begins in a ghost story competition but takes its bearings from the contemporary scientific endeavours of Erasmus Darwin, Humphrey Davy, Giovani Volta, and Luigi Galvani. It looks back and lurches forward, moving between the work of alchemists seeking the elixir vitae and the empiricism of new scientific ideas and techniques for understanding and transforming the physical world.\nGenerically, too, the novel is difficult to categories: emerging from a context of Romantic companions, aesthetics, and experiments, it abandons the supernatural events and superstitions of Gothic fiction. Geographically located in northern, Protestant, and bourgeois countries and set in the present rather than a feudal past, there is little evidence of the castles, abbeys, and ruins so central to Gothic formulas. The desolation and wildness of natural spaces in the novel offer darker reflections on the solitary figures inhabiting them, opening Romanticism to the return of Gothic horror in the \u201cprogressive internalisation and recognition of fears generated by the self \u201d ( Jackson 1981: 24). Self is divided, the novel becomes a psychodrama. At the same time, monstrosity is also found in external formations and institutions: in class antagonisms, revolutionary mobs, legal, social, and familial exclusions (Vlasopolos 1983).\nIndistinctly Gothic, until later revisions and interpretations firm up the association, Frankenstein is also problematically related to science fiction.
