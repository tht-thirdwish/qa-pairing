Facebook consistently resolved these conflicts in favor of its own profits. The result has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats and more combat,\u201d said Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager at Facebook from 2019 until resigning earlier this year.\n\u201cThis is about Facebook choosing to grow at all costs \u2026 buying its profits with our safety,\u201d Haugen told a Senate Commerce subcommittee, saying the company\u2019s problems are \u201csolvable.\u201d\nIn addition to its flagship project, Facebook also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, two wildly popular apps around the world.\nHaugen has been speaking out as a whistleblower in a series of Wall Street Journal stories that began appearing in that publication about three weeks ago. This past weekend she revealed her identity prior to her scheduled testimony on Capitol Hill, and she sat for an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\nDuring the testimony, she gave confident answers in response to the senators\u2019 questions but also declined to answer certain questions when they strayed beyond her areas of expertise. Before joining Facebook\u2019s civic integrity team in June 2019, Haugen worked for Google, Pinterest and other tech companies.\nShe discussed the ways that Facebook\u2019s own attempts to reduce the harm created by its platform are \u201cundone\u201d by the teams designed to increase the company\u2019s user population and the amount of time those users spend on Facebook\u2019s platforms.\nThe harm, she said, is known to Facebook because of its own internal studies and documentation, some of which Haugen provided directly to the Wall Street Journal. But the company does not share its internal information, which has to change, she said.\nFor example, Haugen said, \u201cFacebook knows they are leading young users to anorexia content.\u201d And she said the company actively seeks to attract children to its platforms, especially Instagram, because \u201cthey understand the value of younger users for the long-term success of Facebook.\u201d\nHaugen also pointed to \u201cescalating rates of suicide and depression\u201d among teens. Facebook has continued to seek higher rates of engagement from teens despite \u201ca broad swath of research that usage of social media amplifies the risk for these mental health harms.\u201d\n\u201cFacebook's own research shows that. Kids are saying, \u2018I am unhappy when I use Instagram, and I can't stop,\u2019\u201d Haugen said. She said the platform is designed to essentially be addictive despite these detrimental effects.\nHaugen also cited real-world violence, both around the globe and in the U.S., that has been linked to the flood of disinformation on social media platforms. She pointed to bloodshed in Myanmar and Ethiopia that is allegedly being exacerbated by Facebook\u2019s design. The violence in those countries, she said, is the \"opening chapters of a story so terrifying no one wants to read the end of it.\u201d\nHaugen said she wa", "Whitney Ranch Market Update | October 2023\nThe Whitney Ranch community produced 14 residential real estate transactions in October. This is a meaningful leap from just 9 in September and equals the most significant month to date in 2023.\nAverage price grew from $816,000 in September to over $950,000 in October; a signal that the market is accepting larger and more premium homes despite record high interest rates. In fact both average and median price have surged in 2023 by 15% and 14% respectively providing a remarkable testimonial for the desirability of Whitney Ranch amid some of the most challenging real estate conditions in over a decade.\nThe only metrics that have trended below 2022 are the percentage of sale price to asking price (98%) and days on market (54).

Still, these cases may require a significant burden of proof for self-defense.\nThe key change in the 2005 stand your ground law is protection from prosecution if you are found to be within your rights to protect yourself.\nIf you are initially charged with assault or manslaughter, the arresting officer must provide evidence that you did not have the right to stand your ground. At the same time, your attorney must prove that you operated within your rights to use deadly force.\nYour lawyer will need to demonstrate that you were lawfully permitted to be where the event occurred, that you reasonably believed you were in danger, and that the other party did not try to de-escalate or retreat from the situation.\nYou will be immune from prosecution if your attorney proves these key elements. If you were charged with a crime, your charges would be dropped.\nThe first case of note where the 2005 law applies is Peterson v. State, 983 So. 2d 27, 29 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008). In this situation, the defendant was permitted to seek immunity from prosecution during a pre-trial hearing using a preponderance of the evidence that they complied with the stand your ground law. A pre-trial hearing involves a lower burden of proof than at trial, in which the defendant must prove their rights beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe Peterson case is significant because it upheld the \u201ctrue immunity\u201d provision in the 2005 revised stand your ground law. Defendants arrested in connection with an act of stand your ground self-defense may avoid prosecution entirely if a judge affirms in the pre-trial hearing that the act was justified, which differs from using castle doctrine or stand your ground as an affirmative defense in a criminal trial. Florida\u2019s new laws mean you will not be criminally charged if you are justified in using force.\nIn 2017, though, Florida amended the 2005 statute to place the burden of proof on the prosecution instead of on the defense, as the Peterson decision had. Now, in a self-defense pre-trial hearing, the prosecutor must present clear and compelling evidence that the act was not justified under Florida\u2019s stand your ground criteria.\nExpanding laws to protect perpetrators of deadly force from prosecution \u2014 even when the reason is justifiable self-defense \u2014 will, by nature, be subject to scrutiny and controversy.\nThe national attention the Trayvon Martin case received, in which the defendant, George Zimmerman, was acquitted based on the stand your ground law, shows how polarizing laws like this can be.\nBoth sides have valid reasons for and against the expansion of castle doctrine outside the home, and these reasons affect individual rights, the criminal justice system, and public safety as a whole.\nAdvocates of stand your ground laws note several benefits to Florida\u2019s new legislation, such as:\nThese benefits rest on the belief in an individual\u2019s autonomy and their right to protect themselves, their property, and others. Victims may be able to defend themselves more easily without the responsibility of retreating first.\nThe basis for immunity from prosecution for using deadly force is that the defendant reasonably believed their life was in danger. However, \u201creasonable belief\u201d is subjective \u2014 one of the main concerns opponents of these laws have.\nOther objections include the following:\nSome people believe that laws like this also have an inherent racial bias, in which one person may think they\u2019re under a more significant threat from someone of another race than someone of their own race.\nIs the change to Florida\u2019s stand your ground law effective? Many critics of the law call for legislation reform, noting that it can be abused by violent individuals who take the opportunity to kill even when they can safely walk away. However, the law can also be life-saving if you are in a deadly situation.\nEven if you can prove full justification for using deadly force, you must still prove a prima facie case in a pre-trial hearing per Florida\u2019s burden of proof requirements.

What they found was incredibly shocking \u2013 but unfortunately not so unusual.\n\u201cDee Dee\u201d is actually Donald David McIntosh. According to published records, he is a convicted child molester who served time in jail. McIntosh was a schoolteacher in Morgantown who was convicted on three counts of molesting elementary and middle-school children.\nBut it gets even worse.\nMcIntosh attempted to vacate his conviction on appeal. In the appellate ruling obtained by MassResistance, The State of West Virginia v. David McIntosh, we discovered that according to testimony during the trial against him, McIntosh actually had a long history \u2013 nearly 40 years! \u2013 of abusing minor children who were under his care as a teacher.\nAccording to our West Virginia MassResistance activists in the Morgantown area, Donald McIntosh\u2019s predatory behavior against children was all too well known. The Monogalia County school district allegedly moved him around from school to school, providing cover for the perverted teacher\u2019s predatory behavior. The testimony in his trial came from victims who were in elementary school, middle school, and one in ninth grade (high school) at the time of the crimes.\nAt one point in the late 1980s (according to court documents), in response to complaints the school system mandated that:\nIt appears that the mainstream media was too enamored with the LGBT movement to take the time to look into McIntosh\u2019s background, as bizarre a person as he clearly is.\nBut in fact, it has become increasingly alarming how many LGBT activists are connected to the sex trade, sexual deviance, and even criminal conduct of a sexual nature.\nThese revelations about \u201cDee Dee\u201d McIntosh should be enough to quash the City Council\u2019s further interest in pursuing any kind of non-discrimination ordinance for LGBT behaviors and so-called identities. But of course, this won\u2019t stop the local LGBT activists and the national groups like PFLAG from continuing to push their agenda \u2013 because it doesn\u2019t bother them.

Stand your ground, on the other hand, refers to the right of an individual to confront an imminent threat of violence without the obligation to retreat.\nYes, Florida has a stand your ground law, relieving citizens of the duty to retreat in the face of imminent violence or the perpetuation of a violent crime.\nAnd it\u2019s not the only state that permits people to defend themselves against a threat in places they are lawfully permitted to be \u2014 28 other states and Puerto Rico also have similar laws on their books.\nFlorida\u2019s 2005 revision to this law removes the obligation of someone to retreat before fighting back, a broader level of permission for justifiable force than other states have, which means if you are lawfully permitted to be on premises other than your own private property (house, lawn, etc.), and you\u2019re threatened, then you have the right to defend yourself up to and including using deadly force or committing homicide.\nThe stand your ground law in Florida goes further than the statutes in other states. Sections 776.012 and 776.013 of the Florida Statutes expand the notion of castle doctrine to include permitting individuals to use force in self-defense when threatened outside the home.\nFlorida citizens are also permitted to use deadly force to prevent the commission of a felony, a privilege not afforded to non-law enforcement residents in other states.\nFor example, if you are in line at Wawa and an armed robber comes in, threatening you and asking for money in the cash register, you may fight back with your own weapon to prevent the commission of that felony.\nFlorida\u2019s stand your ground law also exempts you from prosecution if you are within the bounds of self-defense or justifiable homicide.\nThe concept of stand your ground law in Florida isn\u2019t a new one. Its roots extend to a case from the end of the 19th century, Lovett v. State, 30 Fla. 142, 163-64 (Fla. 1892), which permitted a homicide to be excused if the person who committed it reasonably believed there was no other way to prevent bodily harm.\nMore recent Florida stand your ground law examples \u2014 prior to 2005 \u2014 required the potential victim to retreat before opting for deadly force in their own defense. These examples include Weiand v. State, 732 So. 2d 1044 (Fla. 1999) and State v. Bobbitt, 415 So. 2d 724 (Fla. 1982).\nBoth of these decisions affirmed the obligation of the defendant to use every reasonable means to defend themselves before they were legally permitted to use deadly force.\nThe \u201cduty to retreat\u201d requirement in Florida before the 2005 statute revision was based on common law; that is, rulings in Florida appellate courts followed the principle that a defendant must \u201cretreat to the wall\u201d before engaging in the use of deadly force, per Hedges v. State, 172 So. 2d 824, 827 (Fla. 1965).\nFlorida courts also expanded castle doctrine to cover permissible use of deadly force for someone defending their home, occupants, or property, again through common law rulings, not legislation. If the defendant was in their own home when the threat or assault occurred, they were not obligated to retreat before using deadly force.\nFinally, the castle doctrine was expanded in Florida to cover business owners protecting their property under State v. Smith, 376 So. 2d 261 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979).\nAlthough the castle doctrine removes the prior requirement to first retreat in these situations, the defendant must still prove that deadly force was the only viable option to prevent serious bodily harm or death.\nFlorida\u2019s current stand your ground law protects you from prosecution for homicide if you can prove that you believed you or another person was in imminent danger of bodily harm or death or t", "The award-winning silk we sell at This Is Silk is chosen because it is soft, durable and easy and quick to care for.\nIt is also easy to care for when you know how. Silk is the strongest natural fibre on earth. It is a myth that silk is a delicate fabric which can only be dry-cleaned. (The only exception to this is dupion silk which needs an extra level of care)\nIn fact, dry cleaning uses very harsh chemicals that are bad for us. More on that in another blog post.\nSo cast aside your fears about silk. It is the finest fabric known to womankind and so good for our skin and hair that we should not hesitate to use it every day. Once you know what you can and cannot do it is easy to incorporate silk into your daily life and wardrobe.\nWashed and cared for properly, your silk will last for years.\nIn short, it is fine to put your silk pillowcases and silk hair wraps in the washing machine if you do it properly. Washing by hand is superior because there is less friction on the silk and is therefore gentler.\nHere are our guidelines for washing Silk by Hand and in the Washing Machine\nWashing by hand will prolong the life of your silk pillowcases and silk hair wraps and is the gentlest way to clean your silk.\nUse a clean bowl, the kitchen sink or the bathtub and fill it with water that is cool or lukewarm to the touch.\nTake a capful of non-bio liquid detergent suitable for silk (we like Persil Silk & Wool) https://www.persil.com/uk/laundry/detergent/products/persil-silk-wool.html) and swirl around to mix the soap with the water.\nAs an alternative you can use the original Johnson\u2019s Baby Shampoo https://www.johnsonsbaby.co.uk/product/haircare/johnsons-baby-shampoo to clean your silk. Bear with me - as unusual as this seems it is perfectly fine because silk is very similar in structure to our hair and skin.\nSubmerge the silk pillowcase or hair wrap and ensure that it isn\u2019t left to soak for more than 30 minutes. Stirring the silk around gently will help the soap clean thoroughly.\nRinse to remove the soap and squeeze the excess water out.\nSilk dries quickly and is bes", "Photo-restoration and digital editing is our specialty, and we guarantee a very high standard.\nPlease use this form to send photos and details.

Law Rep. 520, 7 A.D. Cases 1598,\n12 NDLR P 28\nPamela OLSON, Appellant,\nDUBUQUE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, Appellee.\nUnited States Court of Appeals,\nSubmitted Jan. 16, 1998.\nDecided March 2, 1998.\nRehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc Denied April 9, 1998.\nSteven A. Stefani, Cedar Rapids, IA, argued, for Appellant.\nMichael J. Shubatt, Dubuque, IA, argued (Allan J. Carew, on the brief), for Appellee.\nBefore RICHARD S. ARNOLD, Chief Judge, MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, Circuit Judge, and SACHS,1 District Judge.\nMORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, Circuit Judge.\nPamela Olson contends that she was fired from her job as an elementary school guidance counselor with the Dubuque Community School District (\"Dubuque\") in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213. On a motion for summary judgment, the lower court held that Ms. Olson had failed to show that she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA and therefore could not make out a prima facie case of discrimination. Ms. Olson appeals; we affirm the judgment of the lower court.2\nIn 1993, Ms. Olson began a new job as an elementary school guidance counselor for Dubuque. She holds a bachelor's degree in elementary education and a master's degree in counseling and human development and, from 1984 until 1993, she was an elementary school guidance counselor with Jessup Community Schools, a smaller school district.\nMs. Olson has a history of depression. On two occasions, she sought medical attention and was able to gain control of her condition within a few weeks. Just prior to taking her position with Dubuque, she began to suffer from depression once again. She felt withdrawn and unable to interact with her co-workers, and she believed that her state of mind adversely affected her job performance. Shortly after she began working at Dubuque, she informed Mary Kay Heilbing, her supervisor, and Lesley Stephens, the principal of the elementary school to which she was assigned, about her condition. She also asked Dubuque to restructure her schedule and to require her supervisors to give more specific direction on how Dubuque wanted her to operate the program to which she was assigned. Dubuque denied her requests, asserting that that was not their management style and that it was her job to organize the program herself.\nMs. Olson then sought medical attention from Dr. Yasyn Lee, a psychiatrist, who placed her on anti-depressant medication. Dr. Lee felt that, by the spring of 1994, Ms. Olson's depression was again under control, and Dr. Lee opined at that time that she was able to \"think clearly, make decisions well, and has good concentration.\" Despite the improvement in her mental health, the evaluations of Ms. Olson's performance for the 1993-94 school year were very negative. Dubuque created a plan of improvement for Ms. Olson for the 1994-95 school year, but when her work did not improve, she was placed on paid leave in the fall of 1994. Following an arbitration hearing, she was terminated from her employment in the spring of 1995.\nTo make out a prima facie case for a violation of the ADA, Ms. Olson must show that she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA. See Aucutt v. Six Flags Over Mid-America, Inc., 85 F.3d 1311, 1318 (8th Cir.1996). Disability under the ADA is defined as \"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [the] individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\" See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2). To establish that she has a disability under \u00a7 12102(2)(A), Ms. Olson must show, in the circumstances of this case, that her depression significantly restricted her opportunities for employment (itself a \"major life activity\") by limiting her ability to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable skills and training. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i); see also Aucutt, 85 F.3d at 1319.\nWe believe that the lower court correctly decided that there was no evidence before it from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Ms. Olson was disabled within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A). Ms. Olson maintained that she was perfectly capable of working as an elementary school guidance counselor, although she asserted that depression often made her unable to perform to her own standards.

The biggest and by far the most important element of the wedding plans, is choosing the venue. Think of it as a canvas with which we are going to create colour, texture and layers inside. We tend to start the design process before we even begin to look for a venue!\nSo what happens if you've picked the venue before hiring a planner or designer? What happens if you've picked somewhere with a strong interior design which is fighting your pinterest board? We thought we'd give you a few tips as this is often a scenario we have to work within.\nI have shared visuals a real event we designed, styled and created florals for here too. So you can see how the space comes to life with a little vision and direction!\n1. Get Writing\nIt may seem silly when talking about visual styling to then begin with words. However it's what we always do. Just grab a piece of paper and write down lots of descriptive words and notes about you and your partner:\n- favourite/least favourite colours\n- places you love to eat - what is the food like, what is the decor like?\n- places you have been on holiday that you fell in love with?\n- where did you meet?\n- what magazines do you read?\n- what does your home look like?\n- what are your hobbies?\n- what is your personal fashion like?\n- favourite flowers\nThen on another piece of paper, start writing down descriptive words about your venue - is it grand, modern, traditional, luxurious, minimalist? Start trying to draw parallels and common themes between your first set of notes, and see if it can start to build a picture for you. For example - you love riding, and reading novels, and your house is full of pattern and rich bold colours but you love wearing black head to toe. Perhaps then you've chosen a more minimalist modern venue? Marry the opposing styles. Cream leather stationery with black text, soft muted neutral tones in the flowers and linen, lots of texture to soften then space, and some contrasting deeper burgundy red to make the styling pop, but with an element of richness.\n2. Write Your Magazine Headline\nOnce you have started to pad out a vision it is time to refine it. I always come up with a headline for my events. I then try to sum it up in just one paragraph. It takes me back to my PR days, and essentially what I want to do is give myself and other vendors involved a clear brief so that we are all working from the same page - it helps focus the mind!\n3. Gather Imagery\nOnce you've come up with an overall idea and summary headline, it's time to get visual! This is when I start to pull in imagery and moodboards. I gather inspiration that fits the brief... it may be a sample from a sofa company, or a dress advertised in a magazine... it might be a single flower stem in the studio that sparked a new idea. If you don't have the time to dedicate to gathering physical items, then it is absolutely fine to utilise tools like Pinterest and Instagram. Just make sure you consider your headline and design paragraph at all times - and ask yourself - does the image fit?\n4. Break It Down\nSo you have a vision and imagery to support it? What next?

For the subject, the onion is a juicy apple and taste good, until the subject is brought back and is told what he has been really eating. Lets go further, one can post hypnotically a condition that a person is tasting an apple every time he bites an onion even when the person is in a conscious state, knowing and is aware what he is actually biting into. Yes this type of conditioning could be used when dealing with weight loss, however we can use the same process and apply it to other aspects.\nThe aspect that I am referring to is within applications of sexual context. The scents and fluids produced by two people during love making can be transformed into delicious tastes and smells that agrees with our personal preferences that is chosen on a conscious or unconscious level. The sound of your partner\u2019s voice can be adjusted to a lower or higher pitch, making the voice of your partner more appealing. In all cases the subconscious has taken in the information that the five senses had captured; and modify that information to fit your preferences into something that feels comfortable for you.\nAltered states with an internal reference that leaves the information taken in by the five senses intact. It may change the kinesthetic feelings or emotions that are involved or that we attach to a particular system, so that a shift in our value system occurs. We can say that the real magic starts to happen when the subconscious is provoked through suggestion to take what is imprinted wipe it out and replace it with something else. In other words, it is possible to fall in love with a plastic object given the correct hypnotic conditioning. Taking this a little further, if you were to given the right suggestions, you may find that a plastic dummy will be more appealing than your ideal concept of beauty, even if the person who fits that ideal concept of beauty were to be standing next to the plastic dummy. Doing this is difficult to accomplish at least in theory, then it is if it were to be done through the external reference. In part because the subconscious would have to create some sort of condition that is not rational to the conscious.

A Washington, D.C. native, Misher had two interceptions and a pair of fumble recoveries last season.

I learned a lot, because we played big schools like Pittsburgh and Maryland. Now I know what to expect coming into this upcoming year.\nQ: Talk about the excitement and challenges that you will face this season with the Conference USA schedule? One of the challenges is that we are playing teams that we did not play last year. We\u2019re expecting a lot from the 2014 incoming class. The great thing is these freshman will start their careers playing this type of competition and they will get four years to play against these big schools.\nQ: How did playing five FBS teams last year prepare you for this upcoming season? It has helped out a lot when we are watching film. When we watched the smaller schools on tape, we couldn\u2019t tell how good their players were.\nQ: How is Washington D.C. different from Hampton Roads? The people in Hampton roads are a lot nicer than people in D.C. I can normally approach them and talk to them about anything.\nQ: Favorite place to eat? In D.C. my favorite place to eat was Chinese Restaurants because of the mambo sauce. I think D.C. might be the only city in the nation that has it. In Norfolk my favorite place to eat is Raising Canes.", "What is the main purpose of the Chatham Arch Neighborhood Foundation (CANF)", "What are some advantages of running outside compared to using a treadmill", "The Chatham Arch Neighborhood Foundation (CANF) was formed in September, 2000, to enable and manage neighborhood projects that can involve capital expenditure, including the installation of vintage-era street lighting and the creation and maintenance of Chatham Commons, the neighborhood pocket park at St. Clair and East streets.\nThe purpose of the foundation is:\n- To promote the preservation of the unique heritage of the area known as Chatham-Arch, an historic residential neighborhood, in Indianapolis, Indiana and to create a total urban environment with respect for the past developed and listed in the National Register of Historic Places;\n- To preserve and restore and replace its artifacts and historical items;\n- To preserve the historic and architectural character of the community through the acq", "What features are included in the detached village house mentioned in the text segment", "knitters on a perfect summer night, on a patio with yummy beer.\nFranklin was there and many other knitters/friends (that's Denny and Ken--go see what Ken is doing, it's good and important and he's awesome) and it was totally fun.

Despite periodic episodes of depression and a belief that she did not receive enough support from her co-workers, she felt she that was doing a \"satisfactory job.\" There is no evidence here that a disability rendered her unable to do her particular job, much less that she was unable to do a broad range of jobs.\nMs. Olson argues that the severe symptoms of withdrawal that she experienced were sufficient by themselves to establish that she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA. She cites an EEOC Enforcement Guidance for the proposition that her poor interaction with her supervisors was the manifestation of a disability. The EEOC notice that she relies on does in fact state that while occasional conflict with colleagues is not sufficient to demonstrate a \"substantial limitation\" within the meaning of the ADA, \"[a]n individual would be substantially limited ... if his/her relations with others were characterized on a regular basis by severe problems, for example, consistently high levels of hostility, social withdrawal, or failure to communicate when necessary. These limitations must be long-term ... to justify a finding of ADA disability\" (emphasis in original). EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Psychiatric Disabilities and the Americans with Disabilities Act \u00a7 9 (March 25, 1997), EEOC Compliance Manual (BNA).\nWhile the EEOC's interpretation of the ADA is entitled to deference, there was nevertheless no evidence before the lower court that Ms. Olson's conflicts with Dubuque were the manifestation of a disability. Ms. Olson sought additional assistance in running the guidance program but was told that it was her duty to run it; uncontroverted evidence shows that she was capable of working in other roles at the school. Although she often felt that she was in an unsupportive and unfriendly environment at the school and that other teachers were distant, there is no evidence that Ms. Olson experienced withdrawal on a \"regular basis\" while at work at Dubuque. Nor is there evidence that Ms. Olson's environment at Dubuque was characterized by \"consistently high levels of hostility\" or that her occasional conflicts with her supervisors were long-term. We cannot say on this record that the lower court erred in holding that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that episodic personality conflicts, a history of depression notwithstanding, without more, were the result of a disability.\nMs. Olson maintains finally that she was disabled within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(C) because her employer regarded her as being disabled. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(l). It is true, as we have said, that Dubuque was generally aware of Ms. Olson's condition, including the fact that she had sought and received medical treatment. Such an awareness is necessary for Dubuque to have regarded her as disabled, but it is not sufficient. There must be more before a plaintiff can survive summary judgment. See Aucutt, 85 F.3d at 1319-20. Ms. Olson suggests that there is more because of the criticism of her work in her 1993-94 performance evaluation. But that evaluation simply identifies the ways in which her supervisors believed that her work was deficient. There is nothing in it that would support an inference that Dubuque regarded her as disabled.\nFor the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the lower court.\nSACHS, District Judge, concurring.\nI agree with the opinion, particularly as it relates to the second year of Ms. Olson's service. This was the critical period in which it was decided that she should not be retained as a school counselor. It was acknowledged at that time that she no longer was suffering from a diagnosed depression. Moreover, the \"accommodations\" urged by Dr. Lee in October 1994 were largely lacking in specificity. In effect, Dubuque was asked to remedy stressful conditions that might create \"increased risk for relapse\" into depression.\nAs stated in a current ruling by the Third Circuit, \"compliance would depend entirely on (the employee's) stress level at any given moment.\" Gaul v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 134 F.3d 576 (3rd Cir.1998). Such an \"amorphous 'standard' \" is not usable to establish an accommodation mandated by law.\nThe Honorable Howard F.

They use sophisticated propaganda and intimidation tactics. They bring in crowds of angry LGBT \u201ccitizens\u201d from surrounding areas (and even other states) to intimidate the politicians and local conservatives. Unfortunately, these campaigns have been successful across the country.\nBut this time our local MassResistance chapter is on the ground to turn their tactics around and derail the push!\nStar City, West Virginia is a fairly conservative suburb of Morgantown. Although the state of West Virginia is relatively conservative, Morgantown (located just south of Pittsburgh) is dominated by West Virginia University and other local colleges. It has become a center for LGBT activism in that region.\nThe \u201cSOGI\u201d ordinance\nNear the end of last year a local LGBT activist \u2013 a bizarre man who dresses as a woman and calls himself Dee Dee McIntosh \u2013 came to the City Council meeting and with a crowd of other LGBT activists. He presented a \u201csexual-orientation gender-identity\u201d (SOGI) non-discrimination ordinance that his group wanted the city to enact.\nDee Dee McIntosh\u2019s ordinance was written by PFLAG, a powerful national LGBT organization that also pushes homosexuality and transgenderism in public schools, colleges, and other public venues across the country. PFLAG has a very active chapter in Morgantown.\nThe text of the ordinance is cleverly crafted to blend homosexuality and transgenderism with race, religion, and other common non-discrimination categories. It says it seeks to \u201cpromote the public health and welfare\u201d and ensure that \u201call persons have equal access to employment, housing, and public accommodations.\u201d\nThe legal penalties for violations of the proposed ordinance are vague. But the real muscle is in a clause that allows the ordinance to be enforced \u201cthrough a private civil action\u201d in court.\nIn other words, it sets up the national LGBT movement to do what they\u2019re doing across America: Swoop in and sue individual businesses who refuse to toe the line on transgender or homosexual demands. And you can be sure that the LGBT activists will be aggressively seeking to entrap local businesses.\nBut even without the \u201cprivate civil action\u201d clause, getting homosexuality and transgenderism written into the city ordinance gives the movement the ability to be in everyone\u2019s faces \u2013 from \u201cgay\u201d parades to \u201cgay/trans\u201d library books, LGBT school programs, and much more.\nWorking to get the ordinance passed\nIn late 2019, the radicals were already moving forward on their propaganda campaign, with their emotional appeal that the town desperately needed \u201ccivil rights protections to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities.\u201d It\u2019s a psychologically confusing approach that can be very effective, especially on weak-minded people who \u201cjust want to be fair.\u201d\nWhen the proposal was presented, the Council sent it to its Ordinance Sub-Committee, but did not subsequently put it on the full Council agenda for discussion. So at the February, 2020 City Council meeting, Dee Dee McIntosh came back with his LGBT group and also got a Morgantown TV station to show up and report on his demand. (Unfortunately for him, the TV report accentuates his deep male voice.)\nDee Dee told the TV reporters he will keep coming to the City Council meetings until the ordinance gets passed. His LGBT activists clearly inten", "The stage is set for the much-awaited high-voltage electoral battle which begins on Thursday with ninety-one Lok Sabha constituencies \u2013 spread across 18 states and two United Territories \u2013 going to polls in the first phase.

An even better logistical styling plan! If you haven't hired someone in to do this for you, you'll need to be extra organised. Liaise with every single vendor involved, including the venue co-ordinator, and schedule carefully what will be delivered, when, and by whom. Be clear on who has responsibility for set up and access. Communicate important details like directions, parking and opening times. Pad your schedule to allow time for delays. Ensure you speak to the photographer so that they have plenty of time to capture your carefully curated event space.

This lead us to altered and external states.\nUsing the subconscious to create specific types of emotional states and new environmental means altering a person\u2019s perception of reality, this is what happens within the field of erotic hypnosis, or even hypnosis in general.
