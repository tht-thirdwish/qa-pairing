The holiday season is the most magical time of the year for a lot of people, but some celebrities have more in common with Scrooge than Santa Claus.\nMiley Cyrus has been candid about her struggles around Christmas and wants her fans to know they aren\u2019t alone. The \u201cPrisoner\u201d singer shared a \u201cSad Christmas Song\u201d in December 2019, which she penned during a lonely period in her life.\n\u201cA sad Christmas song I wrote a few years back right before the holidays,\u201d Cyrus wrote via Instagram at the time. \u201cWas feeling like s\u2013t cause I couldn\u2019t be with the one I loved.

You are as special as a snowflake, beautifully unique and I hope inside your soul feels light, hope, peace, and joy knowing how singularly amazing YOU are! Love always wins!\u201d\nOne year later, Cyrus revealed she wanted to have a \u201cgoth Christmas\u201d vibe", "Listen to this post\nThe battle between old-school nostalgia and modern gadgetry has been raging for centuries, but it seems to have reached a fever pitch in recent decades, given our rapid improvements in technology, increase in consumer demand, and cultural divides between old and new. Vinyl or MP3? Satellite or cable? Books or Kindles? Batman or Superman?\nThis struggle between modernity and tradition is particularly obvious in the world of film, where aging film buffs and modern indie film fans frequently duke it out over which type of film is better \u2013 35 mm, 24mm, 70mm, IMAX, digital\u2026?\nWith the recent resurgence of throwback film techniques (most notably, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s use of 70mm film to shoot his 2015 western thriller The Hateful Eight \u2013 see the clip above), a whole new generation of people are being exposed to some nearly forgotten film styles, and an ancient debate is heating up once again.\nWhat is 70mm Film?\nAs the advertisements for Tarantino\u2019s latest film proudly proclaimed, the movie would be available for viewing in \u201cGlorious 70mm \u2013 Ultra Panavision 70\u201d, and most people had no idea what they meant. Well, 70mm is just another variety of analogue film, more specifically, a film reel with frames that are 70mm in width. The gauge for most motion pictures is 35mm, and while most movies are still wonderful to watch, the difference when you jump to a 70mm gauge is quite noticeable.\nThe resolution of 70mm film is much better than 35mm, providing a richer visual experience and extremely detailed images that are a joy to watch. This type of film also changes the aspect ratio of the film, stretching it to a wider 2.2:1 ratio, rather than the typical 1.35:1 (known as the Academy ratio) or 16:9 (widescreen ratio). This makes 70mm films ideal for larger and wider screens (for example, IMAX films shoot on a special type of 70mm film).\nNow, it\u2019s important to remember that Tarantino is far from the first person to use 70mm film for a movie; in fact, the technology dates back to the very beginning of cinema. Throughout film history, when a director wanted to shoot an epic film, such as Ben-Hur or Lawrence of Arabia, they would choose to shoot on 70mm film. This was perfect for the Panavision movie palaces that featured extremely wide screens and could accommodate the wider image of these early \u201cblockbusters\u201d. However, as the decades passed, movie theaters evolved (and shrank), the popularity of the lighter and less expensive 35mm film grew, and 70mm film fell from popularity, despite its undeniably better quality.\nThe equipment to transport, store, and play 70mm film was expensive, bulky, and difficult to manipulate, as were the cameras u", "erials\nClean with soap and warm water or toy cleaner before and after use.

Also, the maximum possible course grade, Max, is shown below to be just simply the minimum possible course grade plus the weight of the final:\nMax*WT = C*WC + F*WF = C*WC + 100% * WF\nDividing by WT , which is the equal to 100%, we obtain:\nMax = C*WC / WT + 100% * WF / 100% = C*WC / WT + WF = Min + WF\nThus the Max is simply the Min plus the Weight of the Final and inputting the percentages we get:\nMax = 42% + 40% = 82%\nOption 2: You Don't Know your Current Grade\nAn example of our grade calculator for the case when you don\u2019t know your Current Grade is shown below:\nIn this example, because the question \"do you know your current grade?\" is answered \"no\", an extra window appears which has a table that you can manually input all your course work grades and weights in terms of assignments, midterms, homework, labs, etc. Notice that when you input your scores, the grades automatically updates, and vice versa too if you input the grades then your scores automatically update too!\nThe only difference in this example from the example in Option 1 above is that the Current Grade and Weight of the Final are automatically calculated based on the course work that is inputted in the table. In this example, there are 4 assignments with grades 100%, 85%, 83.8%, and 75% along with their respective weights of 4%, 10%, 8%, and 20%.\nThe first calculation that is solved is the Weight of the Course Work, otherwise known earlier as the Weight of the Current Grade, WC, and that calculation is simply the sum of the weights of all the course work as shown below:\nWC = W1 + W2 + W3 + W4 = (4 + 10 + 8 + 20) % = 42%\nThe Weight of the Final, WF, is calculated simply as the difference of the Total Weight, WT, and the Weight of the Current Grade:\nWT = WC + WF\nRearranging to solve for WF and inputting the percentages we get:\nWF = WT - WC = 100% - 42% = 58%\nThe next calculation solved is Current Grade, C, which solved as the weighted average of all the course work as shown below where the course work grades and weights are abbreviated as G1, G2, G3, G4 and W1, W2, W3, W4:\nDividing both sides by WC and inputting the percentages we obtain:\nC = (G1*W1 + G2*W2 + G3*W3 + G4*W4 ) / WC = (100% * 4% + 85% * 10% + 83.8% * 8% + 75% * 20% ) / 42%\nC \u2248 81.44%\nNow that the Current Grade and Weight of the Final are calculated, the Final Exam Grade as well as the Min and Max possible grades are calculated in exactly the same way as in Option 1:\nF = (D*WT - C*WC ) / WF = (80% * 100% - 81.44% * 42%) / 58%\nF \u2248 78.96%\nMin = C*WC / WT = 70% * 60% / 100% = 81.44% * 42% / 100% \u2248 34.20%\nMax = Min + WF = 34.2% + 58% \u2248 92.20%\nBonus Part: Graph and Table of all Possible Course Grades\nA bonus feature of our grade calculator is a table and graph showing all the possible course grades you can end up with as well as the associated final exam grades needed. The graph and table can be viewed after calculating your final exam grade. The calculations used in the table and chart are the exact same as the ones we just solved above but the desired grade is a variable that changes throughout the table.

Ever wonder what those ads are for? Chances are those ads are about Medicare Advantage plans (also known as Medicare Part C), which are offered by private insurance companies and approved by Medicare. Nearly 22 million Americans are on a Medicare Advantage plan currently. In a nutshell, they allow you to get all the coverage Original Medicare (Parts A and B) offers, plus additional benefits and services all in one single plan, such as prescription drug coverage (Part D), often for no additional premium. It is important to remember, that if you join a Medicare Advantage plan, you will still have Medicare. You just will get your coverage from your Medicare Advantage Plan, rather than Original Medicare.\nHow Do Medicare Advantage Plans Work Specifically?\nWhen one joins a Medicare Advantage plan, let\u2019s say here in Texas for instance, Medicare will pay a fixed amount each month to the insurance company and in return, the insurance companies must follow Medicare\u2019s coverage rules (good thing). The Medicare Advantage plans also have yearly contracts with Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans can however charge different out-of-pocket costs and also have different rules for how one gets services (such as needing a referral to see a specialist). These rules can change each year. Your Medicare Advantage plan must notify you about any changes before the start of the next enrollment year, referred to as the \u201cAnnual Notice of Change\u201d (ANOC) by September 30th. Case in point, Aetna Medicare in certain areas of Texas had changed plan numbers for a popular PPO plan late in 2019 and notified all those affected in writing ahead of time that they needed to enroll in the updated Aetna Medicare PPO plan or find a different insurance carrier.The most important thing to keep in mind is that if someone joins a Medicare Advantage plan, they will have the same rights and protections that you would have otherwise under Original Medicare.\nI Heard Medicare Advantage Plans Include Extra Benefits, Is That True?\nThe answer is most likely yes, as benefits differ by plan and frankly by state. One plan offered in Texas may not have the same extra benefits as one in Florida or California but in general, many Medicare Advantage plans include prescription drug coverage, routine vision , hearing, and dental. Some also will include transportation benefits, telemedicine virtual visits so one can \u201cvisit\u201d a doctor from the comfort of their home, a monthly allowance for over-the-counter items, and fitness memberships such as Silver Sneakers, that will give you complimentary access to local in-network facilities, such as Gold\u2019s Gym in San Antonio, Texas for example. These extra\u2019s are unique to Medicare Advantage plans, as Original Medicare will not cover them.\nHow Do I Become Eligible For Medicare Advantage Plans?\nYou\u2019re eligible for a Medicare Advantage plan if you are enrolled in both Original Medicare Parts A and B, live in the plan\u2019s service area, and you do not have end-stage renal disease (kidney failure). To learn how to acquire Medicare Parts A &B, visit our Medicare 101 page. An important note for 2021, is that folks that have ESRD will be able to get on a Medicare Advantage plan. Be sure to double-check that a plan is available in your local area, whether that is San Antonio, Texas, Pensacola, Florida, or even Los Angeles, California. On this note, unlike a Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage plans are not the same in every state, so if you move from let\u2019s say Texas to California, you will have to re-enroll in a new Medicare Advantage plan in that area.\nWhat Do Medicare Advantage Plans Cost?\nLet\u2019s start with the basics first. As you learned from our Medicare 101 page and from above, you must have both Medicare Part A&B to be on a Medicare Advantage plan. For many Americans, Part A is premium free because they worked at least 10 years (40 quarters) and payed Medicare taxes during that time and Part B is dependent on your adjusted gross income from 2 years prior, but typically is $148.50 a month in 2021. Many Americans deduct their Part B premiums from Social Security automatically but we do meet folks who delay their Social Security benefit, in which case they will pay their Part B premiums quarterly.\nMedicare Advantage plans themselves may or may not have a premium, depending on the plan you choose. Typically, HMO\u2019s will be premium-free, and PPO\u2019s will have a premium but this depends on the specific Medicare Advantage plans in your area. You may also run into Medicare Advantage plans that could help pay for some or all of your Part B premium, referred to as a \u201cMedicare Part B premium reduction\u201d. Next, after analyzing Medicare Advantage premiums (if any), you will want to look internally at the policy, to see if you have a deductible (a set amount you pay before certain services are covered), copayment\u2019s/coinsurance\u2019s (a fixed amount or percentage you pay for services, such as $30 to see a primary care doctor), and look at what the annual out-of-pocket maximum is for your plan (the most someone could pay in a calendar year in copay\u2019s/co-insurance\u2019s, before the insurance company covers you 100%). As you learned from our Medicare 101 page, Original Medicare has some real let downs, notably no maximum out of pocket like Medicare Advantage plans have in every plan, typically from $3,400 -$6,700. Some important documents that you want to look at are the Summary of Benefits (SOB) which will give you a general outline of your plan, as well as the Evidence of Coverage (EOC), which goes more in-depth on what your plan will cover.\nAs you will learn below, if someone meets certain income requirements (Medicaid-level), they could potentially qualify to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans that are tailored to low-income Americans called Special Needs Plans (SNP\u2019s). They could potentially not have any costs on a Medicare Advantage plan, such as copay\u2019s/coinsurance\u2019s.\nWhat Are The Payment Stages If My Medicare Advantage Plan Has Drug Coverage Built Into The Plan?\nStage #1- Deducible Stage:\nDuring this stage, if your plan has a deductible, you usually pay the full cost of your drugs up to the deductible amount. This in general, applies to drugs on tiers 3, 4, and 5. Once you reach the deductible amount, you pay a co-payment or co-insurance in the initial coverage stage.\nStage #2- Initial Coverage Stage:\nDuring this stage, the plan pays its share of the cost and you pay a co-payment or co-insurance (your share of the cost) for each prescription you fill until your total drug costs reach $4,130. Once you reach $4,130, you enter the coverage gap or \u201cdonut hole\u201d.\nStage #3- Coverage Gap Stage:\nDuring this stage, you receive limited coverage on certain drugs. You\u2019ll also get a discount on brand-name drugs and generic drugs. This stage continues until your yearly out-of-pocket drug costs reach $6,550. Once your yearly out-of-pocket costs reach $6,550, you move to catastrophic coverage.\nStage #4- Catastrophic Coverage Stage", "What does the writer reflect on during their trip to Utah and the shooting locations they visited", "What\u2019s new in FrontSpin?\n1) Playbook Steps Due Now\nUsers can now see Playbook steps that are due now by clicking \u201cShow what\u2019s due now\u201d checkbox \u2013 this will filter out the steps with 0 contacts in them as well as show users only the contacts that are available to be called/emailed based on the time gap/schedule set in the playbook.

You can also see a specialist, without needing a referral from your primary care doctor. You may also be able to utilize specialty facilities like M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, if they are willing to bill out-of-network with your PPO plan. In most cases, prescription drugs are covered in Medicare PPO plans. If you find out you don\u2019t have drug coverage with your plan, you cannot join a stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D).\nSpecial Needs Plans (SNP\u2019s)-These plans provide benefits and services to people with specific diseases, certain health care needs (like Diabetes), or limited incomes (such as on Medicaid). SNP\u2019s cover the same services that all Medicare Advantage plans cover, but you will have to continuously meet the special conditions to stay on this type of plan. For example, if I am on a Medicare Advantage SEP Dual plan (low income), and I lose Medicaid, this could result in me having to go back to a regular Medicare Advantage plan. With these types of plans, you generally must get care from providers in the network, but some SNP\u2019s may be PPO plans that allow you to go out-of-network. There will be a strong emphasis on managed care with these plans, so referrals will most likely be needed to see a specialist. All SNP\u2019s must provide prescription drug coverage.\nPrivate Fee-For-Service (PFFS) Plans- This kind of Medicare Advantage plan allows you to go to any Medicare-approved provider that accepts the plan\u2019s payment terms and will agree to treat you. If your PFFS plan has a network, these providers have already agreed to the plan\u2019s terms. You will not need a referral to see a specialist with this type of plan. Keep in mind that in a medical emergency, the nearest provider must treat you. In most cases, prescription drugs are covered in Medicare PPFS plans. If you find out you don\u2019t have drug coverage with your plan, you cannot join a stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D).\nMedical Savings Account (MSA) Plans-MSA plans combine a high-deductible insurance plan with a medical savings account that you can use to pay for your health care costs. Besides the Part A&B services that MSA plans must cover, some plans may offer additional benefits like dental coverage for an extra cost. With an MSA plan, you can choose your health care providers. You will need to get a separate stand-alone prescription drug plan (Part D) with this plan option.\nWhen Can I Sign Up For A Medicare Advantage Plan?\nYou can sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan during the enrollment periods below:\nInitial Enrollment Period-When you first become eligible for Medicare, you can sign up during what is referred to as the Initial Enrollment Period (IEP). This 7-month period begins 3 months before you turn 65, the month of your 65th birthday, and ends 3 months after you turn 65. This period is crucial, because you have to make a decision on how you want to receive your Medicare benefits (ie. Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement). So when does coverage start? Well it depends on when you enroll. If you sign up during the first 3 months of your IEP, in most cases, your coverage starts the first day of your birthday month. So if I enroll on March 24th and my birthday month is April, my Medicare Advantage plan would start April 1st. If you enrolled after the initial 3 months, your start date for coverage will be delayed. After enrolling during your IEP, any plan changes can only be made at certain times of the year, as you\u2019ll learn below.\nAnnual Enrollment Period-Remember when we talked earlier about those commercials on television, depicting seniors overly excited about their Medicare plan benefits? Well, this is the time of the year when seniors will be bombarded with such ads on television, in the mail, online, and on the phone. Because October 15th- December 7th, anyone who has Medicare can join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage plan. Coverage will begin on January 1st, so long as you enrolled before the end of December 7th. We caution you to be wary of all the noise you will hear during this time, and to analyze if your Medicare Advantage plan is still working out for you. It never hurts to see what is out there, but be sure to check that all your doctors, medications, and so forth are covered, despite what the fast-talking agent says! Often here in San Antonio, Texas and beyond, we hear horror stories of dishonest agents who were careless in their assistance with seniors, and put them on plans that were less than ideal for them, or suddenly become \u201cunreachable\u201d after they get the sale. Be careful!\nOpen Enrollment Period- This period allows you to switch from one Medicare Advantage plan to another (with or without drug coverage), disenroll from a Medicare Advantage plan and go back to Original Medicare. If you choose to do so, you can then join a Medicare prescription drug plan. You cannot however, go from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage plan/Medicare prescription drug plan, or switch from one Medicare prescription drug plan to another. This period runs from January 1st through March 31st each year. You can only make one change during this period, and any changes made will be effective the first of the month after the insurance company gets your request. If you are having second-thoughts about a Medicare Advantage plan you choose during AEP, this would be a great opportunity to try out a new plan without having to wait a long time.\nSpecial Enrollment Period- In certain situations, you may be able to join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage plan during this period. You must qualify due to certain reasons, such as having both Medicare and Medicaid, receiving \u201cExtra Help\u201d from the government with your Part D drugs, changing where you live and having to enroll in a different Medicare Advantage plan such as from Texas to California, leaving employer coverage, etc. It is vital to pay close attention to deadlines you have during this enrollment period. For instance, you have a 2-month window after your work coverage ends, to acquire a Medicare Advantage plan. If someone is on a SNP plan (remember above) that is tailored for folks on Medicare/Medicaid, they can change to another SNP plan one time during these periods: January-March, April-June, July-September.\nDo I Need To Enroll Each Year?\nThis is a question we get asked often here in San Antonio, Texas, and the short answer is that your plan automatically renews each year as long as you pay the premium and the plan is available in your service area. You do not have to do anything to your coverage, but make sure that the plan is meeting your ongoing needs.\nWhat Are Star Ratings And Why Do They Matter?\nStar ratings are a way for consumers to compare the relative quality of care of Medicare Advantage plans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issues the ratings based on:\n- Administrative Results\n- Clinical Outcomes\n- Plan Member Surveys\nEvery Medicare Advantage plan receives star ratings from one star (lowest) to five stars (highest). CMS also issues an overall star rating for each plan. This matters because if you run into a plan with a low star rating, you might want to research why! This system also matters on the opposite spectrum, because if you run into a 5-star Medicare Advantage plan in your area, such as in San Antonio, Texas, this creates a Special Enrollment Period in its own right, as between December 8th and November 30th, you can enroll in a 5-star plan, one time.\nDo Agents/Brokers Get Paid To Enroll Me On A Medicare Advantage Plan?\nYes. We are real straight-forward folks here at The Harrin Group and want to give you a behind-the-scenes look at compensation. Basically, an agent or broker gets compensated from the insurance company he/she is representing, for every new Medicare Advantage plan enrollment.

Shahan described the lifelong friendships that the AYF fostered along with the organization\u2019s struggle during the times of a non-free and independent Armenia. U. Nairi explained how far the organization has come and how the AYF has affected each of the lives of its members so deeply. After the keynote speakers, U. George Aghjayan gave remarks on behalf of the AYF\u2019s parent organization, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.\nOnce the remarks concluded, the dance portion of the night kicked off. As coffee and dessert were served, a band filled with AYF alumni of different generations got the crowd out of their seats and onto the dance floor. Active and former AYF members alike joined in to dance traditional Armenian line dances. At one point the legendary John Berberian took the stage to perform a guest appearance on the oud. As the dancefloor roared on, attendees continued reminiscing and taking pictures, creating new AYF memories and strengthening old ones. Once the dance ended, an after party was held at a nearby bar where attendees could get in one last drink and bite to eat together before calling it a night.\nAll in all, the AYF 85th Anniversary Gala was a smashing success. Past, present, and future members old and young gathered to celebrate the organization that has had such an effect on their lives.

To register, please click here.\nWhy Should You Attend?\nFTA compliance offers a clear commercial advantage \u2014 preferential duties. When goods qualify for preferential treatment, duties are reduced or eliminated. If you can sell or import products with zero tariffs, you can reduce cost and maximize profit.\nBut It\u2019s Too Complicated!\nFree trade agreement compliance can be complicated and time-consuming. Here\u2019s a quick rundown. Preferential rules of origin are used to determine origin of goods under an FTA. These rules of origin use criteria like tariff shift, regional value content, de minimis and so forth. To qualify their goods, manufacturers must pull production bills of material (BOMs) and perform content calculations. If their goods qualify, they must prepare and disseminate FTA certificates of origin. They may also need to reassess their products multiple times during the year. Changes to legislation, costs, BOMs or suppliers can impact whether or not a finished product qualifies under an FTA.\nDoing all of this manually is certainly a challenge. That is why most organizations don\u2019t bother. Only 30 percent of multinationals take advantage of all the FTAs that they could. Think about that \u2014 70 percent of multinationals are ignoring a competitive advantage.\nFree trade agreements are not static. To give you an example, here are some FTA news stories, all from this week.\nThe WTO recognizes more than 450 FTAs. For a multinational working across the globe, keeping up with all FTA legislation and remaining compliant can seem too much like hard work.\nThere is An Easier Way\nYes, FTA compliance can be complicated. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. It is possible to automate the most complex and time-consuming aspects of FTA compliance. Join us on November 28th, 2018 at 1:00 pm CST for a 30 minute webinar.

What is the logic behind interventions of private financial institutions in artistic and cultural space of so-called Southeastern Europe? What is their relation to public institutions? How can we understand these interventions within the framework of re-awakened Austrian imperialist aspirations? How are interventions by actors other than governments and private financial institutions (for example artists, curators) connected to coloniality and western exceptionalism?

Forces are put together not only to investigate what the creativity of the \u201cdeveloping Other\u201d is about, but also what the \u201cdeveloping Other\u2019s\u201d emancipation is about, or better yet, where the developing Other is now on the scale of the implementation of neo-liberal values.\nIn 2009 numerous exhibitions have been staged, artworks produced and symposia organized, as Europe was in the euphoria of celebrating the triumph of capitalism: the anniversary of twenty years of the fall of the Berlin Wall. One such project is the Gender Check exhibition, investigating femininity and masculinity in Eastern European art since the 1960s, initiated by the Erste Foundation at the MUMOK.\nOur intervention takes such projects as a point of departure for a critical reflection of the ongoing Western investigation and control of democratic values and social emancipation in countries that recently joined, and those which are about to join the EU (as well as in other regions). Exhibiting role models of femininity and masculinity in Eastern Europe follows a strict logic of identity politics as they make it possible to identify, fragmentize, categorize and make the Other visible, and therefore, controllable.\nParallel to that investigation and control of political values, state-legitimized racism and patriarchal models of exclusion in Western countries are perpetually reproduced. Both practices, inside and outside of Western imperial centers, follow the same logic of strengthening former colonial powers through systematic exploitation and marginalization. We can find a continuity of colonial practices in the way that the \u201cEastern\u201d and \u201cSouthern\u201d worlds are perceived as uncivilized, underdeveloped and barbaric and how migrants are constantly supervised, accused and criminalized in Western countries themselves.

These options are listed below:\n1) If you know your Current Grade, select Yes (note that this is the current course grade before taking your final exam)\n2) If you don't know your Current Grade, Select No\nFor the second option, you would need to know all the scores or grades of your course work such as assignments, midterms, labs, homework, etc. Once you input these, as well as the weight or worth of each course work, our calculator automatically calculates your Current Grade as well as the Weight of the Final. The breakdown of the calculations behind both options are shown in the sections below.\nOption 1: You Know your Current Grade\nAn example of our grade calculator for when you know your current grade is shown to the right. The example has inputs of 80% for the Desired Grade, 70% for the Current Grade, and 40% for the Weight of the Final Exam. The resulting Grade Needed on the Final Exam is calculated, which is 95%, as well as the minimum and maximum attainable course grades, which are 42% and 82% respectively.\nThe calculation for solving the Grade Needed on the Final Exam follows the concept of a weighted averaged and the resulting equation used is shown below:\nDesired Grade * Total Weight = Current Grade * Weight of Current Grade + Final Grade * Weight of Final Grade\nIf we simplify the equation above by abbreviating each of the terms we get:\nD*WT = C*WC + F*WF\nNow the concept of \"weights\" simply means how big of a chunk of the total possible grade is any given grade worth. In our case the total possible grade, or total weight (WT) is just 100% and is broken down into two parts: Course Work (which is represented by the Weight of Current Grade (WC) and the Weight of the Final Exam (WF). Thus we have:\nWT = WC + WF\nWT = 100%, WF = 40%\nRearranging to solve for WC we get:\nWC = WT - WF = 100% - 40% = 60%\nPercentages as Units\nAnother important note to consider is that percentages can be viewed in the same way as any other unit, such as feet, inches, kilograms, pounds, etc., because in this case the conversion is simply dividing the percentage by 100. Thus 100% = 100/100 = 1 and 7% = 7/100 = 0.07. The idea behind percentages is to represent ratios and fractions in terms of being a fraction of the number 100 because it is often times easier to understand this way. For example, the fraction 4/5 = 0.80 = (0.80 *100)% = 80% and always equals 80/100. Thus the fraction 80/100, although the same as 4/5, is easier to comprehend because it deals with the very common number 100.\nSolving for the Final Exam Grade\nNow to get back on track with the derivation above for the Final Exam Grade, F, needed to get a Desired Grade, D, we can simply rearrange the equation shown above and input the known terms as follows:\nD*WT = C*WC + F*WF\nF = (D*WT - C*WC ) / WF = (80% * 100% - 70% * 60%) / 40%\nNow if we consider the percentages, %, simply as units and cancel accordingly as well as factor out the remaining percentage unit, we obtain:\nF = (80*100% - 70*60%) / 40 = (80*100/40 - 70*60/40) % = 95%\nThus we need 95% on the final exam to obtain a desired overall course grade of 80%.\nMinimum Possible Course Grade\nThe minimum possible grade is for the case when you obtain 0% on your final exam, or in other words, the lowest possible grade on your final exam. In this case use the s", ">>BY JESSICA WILKERSON, PhD Candidate in History, UNC-Chapel Hill I recently had a conversation with a family member\u2014let\u2019s call her Sally\u2014who is convinced that our cousin, who is poor and struggles with drug addiction, got pregnant so that she could receive more Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, or food stamps. \u201cYou think she sees a baby as her ticket to more food?\u201d I asked, perplexed. \u201cWell, she probably sells her food stamps for drugs,\u201d Sally explained. I responded that I\u2019m pretty sure that would be very difficult, if not impossible, but it\u2019s no use: Sally is convinced that our cousin\u2014who has been so crippled by drug addiction that she cannot work and has lost custody of her children\u2014is manipulating the system. Without any evidence that this is the case (reports show that \u201ctrafficking\u201d food stamps is extremely rare), this is Sally\u2019s ready anecdote that food stamps are ineffective.\nSally is not alone, and she is not unreasonable for thinking that the program is flawed. The public debate on the food stamp program often focuses on problems, from stories of widespread abuse, to >>reports linking food stamps to obesity and diabetes, to warnings that the program is a fundamental cause of the nation\u2019s debt. Such reports have only multiplied as debates on the Farm Bill\u2014legislation that funds agriculture and nutrition programs\u2014reignited in Congress with the last extension set to expire in January. The message thus far has been that cuts are in order (beyond the $5 billion that went into effect on November 1). The Senate has proposed $4.5 billion in additional cuts in the coming decade while the House proposed $40 billion.\nThe history of food stamps is too often missing in these debates. In the early 1960s a series of studies showed that hunger and malnutrition were pervasive in poor regions of the country. Doctors reported high rates of anemia in infants, stunted growth and low hemoglobin levels in children, and pregnant women suffering from nutritional deficiencies. Prompted by these findings, national public figures addressed the question: What can we do about hunger and malnutrition in our nation? That question motivated President Lyndon B. Johnson and his administration to oversee the Food Stamp Act of 1964, legislation that built on food assistance programs established during the Great Depression. In his statement upon signing the legislation, Johnson declared that in a nation like ours, with abundant food, no child should go hungry. With the right amount of cooperation between state and federal governments, hunger was a problem that could be solved.\nThe effects of the Food Stamp Act were not immediate. As we continue to consider the role of food assistance in our society, we should remember the many poor and working mothers who fought for better access to food stamps in the 1960s. In the years just after the Food Stamp Act passed, there were many problems with the program. Families had to purchase food stamps, making them unavailable for the most cash-poor households. Moreover, not all counties offered the program, so many people did without.\nIn 1968 Senator Robert F. Kennedy joined civil rights and labor groups to investigate poverty-related hunger across the nation.

On Saturday, July 21, 2018 that growth was celebrated by the very families who created those traditions. The AYF-YOARF\u2019s 85th Anniversary Gala brought multiple generations of AYF lifers together in Warwick, Rhode Island for a night of nostalgia, outlook, and a good old fashioned AYF barehantes.\nThe night began with a cocktail hour. Upon arrival, guests reconnected with old friends and discussed their time in the AYF over drinks and mezze. At the front of the cocktail hour area stood a table curated with AYF memorabilia from years past. Guests flipped through previous Olympic ad books, looked at printed pictures from events past, and read from old AYF song books. On one of the back walls played a slideshow of pictures which hundreds of members submitted of their fondest AYF memories. Along each of the back walls hung informational posters detailing AYF chapters past and present. A step and repeat with the AYF logo and an image of Karekin Nejdeh (the organization\u2019s founder) was the perfect place to capture a group shot of another great AYF event.\nAfter the cocktail hour came dinner and the program, emceed by U. Josh Tevekelian. U. Josh described his experiences within the organization and the lessons it has taught him that have stuck with him to this day. He then introduced the night\u2019s keynote speakers, U. Rosemary Alashaian, U. Shahan Avedian, and U. Nairi Khachatourian. Each speaker represented a different AYF generation in the room. U. Rosemary spoke of her days in the AYF during its relative infancy and creating a family", "ied about their hardships and why they needed food assistance. Many of them outlined in painstaking detail how they spent every penny\u2014on food, medicine, bills, school expenses\u2014and how they often ran out of money and food by the end of the month. Those who received food stamps noted that without them, their lives would have been even more difficult. Food insecurity was often a starting point for women to discuss the many facets of poverty. Their testimonies underscored the lack of well-paying jobs for women, how they often made tough choices about how to spend money as they juggled food and medical expenses, and how they faced financial collapse when a husband died or left a family.\nOther women campaigned at their state capitals and county courthouses, demanding that food stamp offices open in their communities. For rural women especially, with no public transportation, poor roads, and miles between them and food stamp offices, traveling to offices was a hardship, one more in a litany of burdens.\nWomen\u2019s persistent efforts to make the system more responsive to those most in need led up to the 1977 Food Stamp Act, a bipartisan bill which made food stamps more accessible to poor families. Women also played a role in the establishment of the program Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) which assists low-income mothers with children up to age five.\nThe women who testified to make the food assistance programs work better were not attempting to cheat the system. As one woman testified at a hearing in Kentucky, \u201cOf course I want to pay if I can and I feel that anybody that can pay it should pay it, but right now we just can\u2019t.\u201d It was probably not easy for women to stand before public officials and tick off their household expenses, share their personal hardships, or admit that they could not always feed their children. But they did so because then, just as now, there were pervasive myths that people on welfare and food stamps were lazy, dependent on government, and undeserving of public assistance, even as their experiences as well as the data revealed a complex portrait of poverty.\nBecause of those women and the public officials who listened to them, food stamps have become one of the most successful social programs in our country. While the SNAP program can be improved, its limitations do not take away from the fact that severe malnutrition, a surprisingly prevalent problem in the 1960s, has been nearly wiped out, according to the >>Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nDespite the program\u2019s successes in preventing severe food insecurity, once again we are coming to a moment when years of hard work is being called into question and >>SNAP recipients are facing severe cuts to public assistance. Myths about the food stamp program distract us from that success story. They render invisible the history of how poor and working mothers helped to usher in a program that has shielded thousands from hunger, malnutrition, and the harshest effects of poverty.\nJessie Wilkerson is a Ph.D. Candidate in Women\u2019s and Gender History at UNC Chapel Hill, and she is currently an AAUW American Fellow.

If I Needed Someone (1966)\nThe jingle jangle ring of Rickenbacker guitar that lights up this Revolver album track was said to be influenced by The Byrds\u2019 The Bells Of Rhymney. Some trademark Beatles harmonies made this song an easy target for fellow hitmakers The Hollies to cover \u2013 however at the time, their version was lambasted by Harrison and barely scraped into the top twenty.\n9. It\u2019s All Too Much (1967)\nTune in and turn on for a classic slice of LSD influenced psych. Recorded in June 1967, this chugging singalong was eventually used on Yellow Submarine over a year later. By then, the Beatles had gone back to simpler sounds. This Harrison freak out is therefore a memorable ode to the summer of love. In 1976, Steve Hillage covered the song on his L album.\n8. Long, Long, Long (1968)\nA dreamy lament which can be found languishing on side four of the Beatles White Album. Be sure to seek it out, as this is one of Harrison\u2019s most affecting lyrical themes. Note the added effect at the close of the song \u2013 the sound of a wine bottle reverberating on top of an amp.\n7. Blue Jay Way (1967)\nHarrison\u2019s contribution to their Magical Mystery Tour TV film was a suitably phased psychedelic journey. It tells the tale of \u2018a fog upon LA\u2019 as Harrison, on a visit to Los Angeles in August 1967, awaited the arrival of Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. Blue Jay Way was the name of the street in Hollywood Hills where he was staying.\n6. I Me Mine (1970)\nThis pleasing waltz time rocker was one of the very last Beatles song to be worked on.

This Section does not contain the words \u201cexclusively\u201d, \u201csolely\u201d or \u201conly\u201d to support the exclusive causation standard. Therefore, prior cases that required exercise of workers\u2019 compensation rights as the exclusive cause of discharge have flawed reasoning as they are unsupported by the plain language in the Statute and should not be followed.\nThe Court found the \u201ccontributing factor\u201d standard should apply to causes of action that arise pursuant to Section 287.780. This standard serves two purposes: first, the contributory factor language is consistent with the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cin any way\u201d and fulfills the purpose of the Statue, and second, this standard now aligns workers\u2019 compensation discrimination with other Missouri employment discrimination laws. The Court noted there can be no tolerance for employment discrimination in the work place and that this was illegal and reprehensible. Employer\u2019s argument was that abandoning the exclusive causation standard would permit an employee who was fired for legitimate reasons such as tardiness, absenteeism or incompetence at work to still be able to maintain a cause of action for discharge if the worker could persuade a fact finder that, in addition to other causes, a cause of discharge was the exercise of rights under the workers\u2019 compensation law.\nThis case decision offers employees more protection in exercising their workers\u2019 compensation rights and less fear from being terminated or discriminated against in their employment.

Today, there are limited resources in terms of projectors that can play 70mm film, let alone projectionists trained to expertly show these types of films on a regular basis.\nEssentially, 35mm film did to 70mm film what digital film is currently doing to 35mm film\u2026 making it obsolete. 35mm film was more manipulable for different formats, and could be squeezed and bent more easily without distortion, unlike 70mm film.\nThe Digital Revolution\nTraditional motion pictures are recorded on analog film frames, whereas digital film is recorded as digital video images. That is a fundamental difference that creates a very different visual experience for movie-goers who prefer \u201cthe real thing\u201d. Digital film is captured like a digital photograph, using light sensors and digital receptors to resolve the image, but that\u2019s only the very basic version.\nHigh-definition video (Hi-def) has even better resolution, and this has since been followed up by 2K and 4K, creating an arms race to create the most incredibly clear and detailed movies on the market. Digital film is useful and preferred in many instances because it can be crunched down to whatever size is most convenient, without losing much resolution. For example, a new movie that is shot on digital film, rather than celluloid film, can be manipulated and shrunk to fit on the screen of a tablet or smartphone without compromising picture quality.\nIn a mobile, device-oriented society, this flexible capability makes it more profitable and sensible for most directors to shoot films in a digital format. Even most old movies have been re-recorded in digital formats for that same reason \u2013 ease of distribution and consumption.\nOne might think that with our ever-advancing digital technology, the resolution would be far better in a high-definition digital film, making the discussion of 70mm vs. digital superfluous. However, high-format celluloid films (70mm) have relatively comparable, if not better, resolution than high-definition digital films. There is also an authentic edge to old-school cinematography, which is often lost in the glossy, sterile, and polished appearance of digital projection.\nWhile neither of these two formats can be called \u201cbetter\u201d than the other, the decision of whether to support or see a digital film vs. a 70mm film truly comes down to personal preference.

Any employee who has been discharged or discriminated against shall have a civil action for damages against his (or her) employer.\u201d This means that an employer may not terminate an employee due to the fact that the employee has exercised his or her rights regarding a workers\u2019 compensation claim against the employer.\nThe question was whether employee had to show his filing of a claim was the exclusive or only reason why employer fired him or her, or whether this filing of a claim caused or contributed to the discharge, even though it may not have been the only reason, for example, employee had disciplinary write-ups as well.\nThe Court went through a causation analysis, looking to the Missouri Human Rights Act (\u201cthe MHRA\u201d) and public policy wrongful termination claims decisions.
