Wye Oak boasts as being the only Merge Records (same home of Camera Obscura!, and of course, Superchunk!) band to have played in a gay bar (390 Shanghai) in China. Seriously though, I haven\u2019t seen a live show this compelling in a long time. This may not be the sort of music I\u2019d immerse myself in these days, but everything about the band felt like I should\u2019ve paid much, much more than the 70RMB admission. I don\u2019t know about the folk-tinged music label they seem to be associated to, but this was easily precious and honest indie rock.

Now with his new album Illuminate coming out Sept. 23, the singer-songwriter opened up to Billboard in an interview that came out this morning about what this next stage in his career is really like.\nThe piece talks about everything from his fans to his outlook on love. The headline notably reads that \"fans don't truly know him,\" and later, the article quotes Shawn as saying that he is \"careful\" around his fans because \"You can't let them take everything from you. Because they will \u2014 not in a malicious way.

It was as if he were compelled by the Lord to receive Holy Communion. When he asked the Empress to tell the priest that he wished to receive Communion, she told him that it was not possible because Countess Mensdorff was going to receive the only host consecrated. Emperor Karl could not be dissuaded, so Empress Zita went to the priest and saw that he too must have had an inner voice because he had consecrated an additional host for the Emperor.\nAs Emperor Karl lived, so did he die. In life he was united with our Eucharistic Lord, and the Blessed Sacrament was the center of his life when he died. Half an hour before he died he wished to receive Holy Communion. Although his face was pale and drawn from his long, tiring struggle with illness, his face radiated with joy as he received the Eucharist. This radiance remained on his face after his death. During the Emperor\u2019s final moments, Father Zs\u00e1mboki held the Blessed Sacrament before his eyes, and in the presence of the Eucharist he said his final words:\nThy Will be done, Jesus, Jesus, come!\nWith his final breath, he whispered:\nHe now entered that eternal light, which is symbolized by the sanctuary lamp he had so carefully attended in his chapel.\nMy Lord and God, according to the marvelous example of Your servant, Emperor Karl, I will visit You in the tabernacle frequently, and receive You with joy and longing in the most Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist.

Lead singer and guitarist David Boldt is the only remaining original member of the group, having been in Grey Television since it began three years ago. In the first year particularly, he shared that there was a rotating cast of various musicians, but the current lineup began to form two years ago when Blazy and drummer and programmer Maximilian Garth joined.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s also the point when the band really got started,\u201d Garth said, referencing how the solidified membership \u2013 which also includes guitarist and keyboardist Julius Barg and bassist Mirko Zipris \u2013 lent itself to increased productivity and more of an overall direction with the music.\nAnd whereas the band once had an idea of the music it wanted to create but wasn\u2019t certain how to attain that, now the members feel they\u2019ve begun to learn how to write together.\n\u201cOne year ago it was really, really, really hard to create a song,\u201d Boldt said. \u201cNow we\u2019re close to the sound we really want to have.\u201d\nSpecifically, the goal is to merge the common musical interests of all five but incorporate each member\u2019s own individual taste and still be happy with the results. This can be tricky sometimes, considering the gamut of genres that runs throughout the group; whereas Barg is interested in German indie music and Boldt listens to underground post-punk, Garth is a fan of techno music.\nNaturally, these styles can clash, and this difference can give way to a fair share of disputes about the direction of the sound, but the longer the band is together, the less of an issue this becomes.\n\u201cWe found a way to work together so that everyone can put his ideas into the song,\u201d Blazy said, referencing something that can only come about as a result of time.\nSomething else that has changed in the past couple years has also been the songwriting process.

It\u2019s usually very pared down and minimal, consisting of only what you need during a specific season or time of year.\nThe goal behind capsule wardrobes is to 1) make dressing simpler and more convenient and 2) keep your closet neater and better organized. They\u2019re also a great option if you\u2019re limited on closet space (or you share a closet with someone else.)\nHow to Build a Capsule Wardrobe\nStep 1: Pare down your existing closet to just the basics.\nYour first job is to go through your existing closet and purge anything you don\u2019t actively wear, doesn\u2019t fit, or you just don\u2019t like anymore. Eventually, you want to get down to just basic, foundational pieces of clothing that you can build on, layer, and mix and match with your more seasonal pieces.\nHere\u2019s what the experts suggest having in a standard capsule wardrobe:\n- 3 basic t-shirts in black, white, and grey\n- 3 tank tops in black, white, and grey\n- A white button up shirt\n- A simple, black dress\n- A black or grey blazer\n- 2 tailored pair of jeans in blue and black\n- A black pencil skirt\n- 2 pairs of shorts, one black and one blue\n- A gold watch\n- A black leather bag\nIf you don\u2019t already have these items, you may need to do a little shopping. Keep in mind that you\u2019re going for versatility, so steer clear of anything patterned, printed, or super tailored to one specific season or occasion.\nStep 2: Gather seasonal items to enhance those basics.\nOnce you\u2019ve got your foundational pieces all rounded up, it\u2019s time to gather the more seasonal items to build on those.\nFor the winter, you\u2019ll want:\n- A cardigan or sweater to layer over your tees\n- 2 pairs of boots, one dressy and one for harsh weather\n- A trench coat in black or tan\n- 2 scarves\n- A pair of rain boots\n- A leather jacket\n- A cashmere cardigan or wool sweater\n- A blue jean jacket\n- A bathing suit, along with a sheer cover-up or wrap\n- 2 pairs of sandals, o", "What is the central debate discussed in the text segment regarding YouTube content uploading", "What is the purpose of the President's Cup tournament according to Baltimore City Comptroller Joan Pratt", "What is the purpose of the Tennessee Icons 3D Stickers from La Petites", "n freely explore the world of Pocketown.

Other times, someone will have an idea and work to develop it with one or two other members, in a subgroup. Then, once the direction of a song becomes more established, the members working on it will present it to the rest of the band\nThis seems to work, Boldt said, because the ideas are more compact when shared between two or three people, as opposed to initially being developed and built upon by five people at once. Blazy added that, in addition to being more efficient, this helps to eliminate the egos that can arise in a band with so many people contributing to the creative process.\nMeanwhile, Garth admitted that not everyone is always pleased with every song, but each member is willing to make sacrifices in personal visions from time to time for the sake of the band, something that becomes easier the longer they are together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a compromise,\u201d Boldt explained. \u201c[But] it\u2019s compromise [that] everyone can live with.\u201d\nTo date, Grey Television has played handfuls of one-off shows and opened for bands like Foals and Battles, but the goal for 2012 is to go on a full-fledged tour. Additionally, the band will be putting out some new music this Spring, including a new single in the coming months and a music video for another song which is projected to be released in May.\nAnd while label interest is always nice, that\u2019s nothing something Grey Television is necessarily interested in, preferring to keep things D.I.Y. This is largely due to the fact that the five work so well together, that bringing in a label, or figurative sixth member, could disrupt the harmony.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of great to see that you have an idea, but you don\u2019t have the words [and] the other one knows what you want,\u201d Boldt said, speaking to the idea that the bonds between the members are a lot like a relationship.\nZipris agreed, sharing that every additional band practice and live performance only reinforces what Grey Television is doing.\n\u201cI think we grow.

This correspondence demonstrates that black holes and quantum mechanics are compatible, resolving the black hole information paradox. It also provides a useful tool for the study of strongly coupled quantum systems, giving insights into a range of problems from high temperature nuclear matter to high temperature superconductors.\nNathan Seiberg \u2014 For major contributions to our understanding of quantum field theory and string theory.

Things like purses, bold necklaces, hair wraps, a great pair of sunglasses and other items can really enhance your foundational pieces and help you make a statement.\nStep 3: Organize\nYour foundational items should stay in your closet year-round, but your seasonal items? Those should get put away until it\u2019s time to use them.\nIf you have space under your bed, invest in four under-the-bed storage containers, and use one for each season. Just be sure to label each one so things don\u2019t get mixed up along the way.\nIf you\u2019re limited in under-the-bed space, you may want to look into vacuum storage. You just put your items in a bag and the vacuum sucks all the air out, giving you a small, flattened bag that can easily go on a shelf or in a cabinet somewhere.\nStep 4: Rotate and update.\nYou should update your seasonal capsule wardrobes at least once a year to make sure they all contain items that still 1) fit your body comfortably and 2) match your personal style and preferences.\nIf you add any items to one of your wardrobes, make sure you remove something else to make up for it. This will keep your closet from brimming with clothes you don\u2019t wear again.\nYou should also check regularly to make sure your foundational pieces are in good condition. The entire capsule model relies on those basic items, so if something looks worn or shabby, be proactive and replace it before it\u2019s too late.\nOne More Tip\nA good closet organizer can be a game-changer when it comes to a capsule wardrobe. You\u2019ll need hooks to hang jewelry and purses, shelves for shoes, and baskets for smaller items and accessories. Most home improvement stores have organizers you can piece together, depending on the size of your closet. You can also bring in a pro to install a more comprehensive organization system, if you prefer.\nWe Can Help\nNeed cash to expand that closet, add in an organizer, or make some other upgrade around the house?

Yuri Milner, who has made his fortune investing in social-media companies, announced the new Fundamental Physics Prize this morning. The winners work on difficult problems ranging from the Universe's early inflation to string theory (see box).\nAt $3 million a head, the new prize dwarfs the Nobel Prize, which this year is valued at around SEK8 million ($1.2 million). It also exceeds other well-known awards such as the Kavli Prize and the Shaw Prize, which are valued at $1 million each.\nNews of the award came as a shock, even to the winners. \"It was a complete surprise,\" says Edward Witten, a theoretical physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, who won an award for his work on string theory.\nAt 50 years old, Milner is something of an overnight sensation in California's Silicon Valley. In the past three years, he has invested heavily in social-media companies including Twitter, Facebook and Spotify. Today his various investment funds are worth an estimated $12 billion, and his private worth is set at $1 billion.\nHe created the prize out of a love of theoretical physics, which he studied at Moscow State University and the Russian Academy of Sciences during the 1980s and early 1990s. The initial prizewinners were chosen by Milner himself. Unlike other awards, such as the Nobel Prize, the new award can be given to theorists whose ideas have not yet been supported by data. The goal is to reward groundbreaking concepts that are driving theoretical thinking forward.\n\"The intention was to say that science is as important as a shares rating on Wall Street,\" Milner told Nature. The new money comes with no strings attached, but he hopes that the prize will raise public recognition of theoretical physics and that the award recipients will deliver public lectures that will become as popular as Richard Feynman's famous lectures on physics.\nThe new awards were not recieved warmly by all in the theoretical community. Some of the winning theories, such as string theory, are basically untestable, says Peter Woit, a mathematician at Columbia University in New York, who is a well-known critic of speculative ideas. And others, such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions, are under serious strain as a result of new measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a massive particle accelerator located near Geneva, Switzerland (see 'Theorists feast on Higgs data'). \"A bunch of people are getting $3 million for doing something that is untestable or has just been shown to be wrong,\" he says.\nMoreover, he says, the prizewinners come from a few elite institutions (four of the nine are from Princeton's Institute of Advanced Study). The net effect may be to reinforce the old guard, rather than encouraging new thinking, he warns.\nIn response, Milner says that he is not yet convinced that the LHC has disproven ideas such as supersymmetry. \"I think the LHC has not shown its full potential; I think we should talk about it in the next few years,\" he says.\nAs for the panel's composition, he admits that \"any nine names I would have chosen would not be a perfect set\". Future prizewinners will be chosen by winners from previous years. As the prize committee gradually expands, Milner believes that any imbalances in the panel will self correct. Each"]}
