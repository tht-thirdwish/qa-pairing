The blog sites are aggregated on the Military Blogging web site.\n- Thousands of non-profit organizations serve military, soldiers, veterans, and families.\n- Throughout this community of military bloggers, they all have a sense of responsibility toward families.\n- As military families engage, the expression and sharing of small frustrations is often what ties military spouses together, regardless of their location.\n- Social media has enabled a community of individuals who are passionate about the military to form tight bonds of respect, admiration, trust, expectations, and influence among this community.\n- Over time, these bloggers have become influential not only among their own online communities, but also in making a difference in perceptions, policy, and legislation.\n- One reason for their influence is that blogging has moved to, and is encouraged, by soldiers and others to tell real stories.\n- Though some of the early bloggers, started blogging anonymous, now it seems that there is not a concern of separating personal life and professional life online. In fact, telling own personal stories are encouraged.\n- @pricefloyd, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, says that military needs more conversations on topics about the military.

The tempo is slower in this song but more to prepare you for what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming next.\nThere is always an anthem in every Breaking Benjamin album, where the listener gains strength from the music.

The awesome thing about Breaking Benjamin is they take on the sound and color essence. You can feel the color of the albums, transition to meet the color in the sound. Definitely a standout track, and familiar as well.\nChord progression takes you for a ride on this track. Burnley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice is a smooth lullaby.

During extended periods of gaming, the S6 Edge doesn\u2019t seem to slow down the processor for the first 15 minutes. Even after that, the effects of throttling are not as apparent as on most other smartphones. If you are a big gamer and play high-end games on your phone, you will love the S6 Edge.\nThe Manhattan and T-Rex tests on GFX Bench heat up the S6 Edge, and if you run the AnTuTu test right after that, you\u2019ll notice a drop in the score. However, this score will still be higher than the Moto Turbo and Nexus 6, which is saying something.\nWhen this is done in an air-conditioned room, the heating is less and the phone can run at its best for a little longer.\nThe only performance issue I can point out is that some apps kept crashing unless I restarted the device or closed all applications manually. The problem is obviously a RAM management issue, which is software related. That\u2019s good news because it allows Samsung or Google to fix it via a software update.\nDespite its peak performance, none of the above reasons is the main reason to buy the Galaxy S6 Edge. What you should buy it for is the 16MP rear camera. Yes, the 5MP front camera is pretty nice too, but the rear camera is the real hero of this device.\nThere is an image in the gallery below, which was taken from a car traveling at 60 km/h. Without the title on that image, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell it was taken in such circumstances. That\u2019s how fast the S6 Edge\u2019s camera locks in focus. The same can be done using the iPhone 6 but what explains the fuss about this being better than the iPhone?\nWell, everything else. The S6 Edge takes clearer photos than the iPhone 6 and handles details better (that comparison follows, by the way). Plus, it\u2019s just as good as the iPhone 6 in white balance. In a recent comparison between the Galaxy S6 Edge and the Xiaomi Mi4iwe noticed the similarities in the white balance algorithms.\nSo, to answer the questions, yes, it has a better camera than the iPhone and is the best camera Samsung has produced to date. The camera can get even better in the hands of a pro, who can take advantage of Samsung\u2019s Pro Mode for the camera.\nOn a 2,600 mAh battery and a QHD display, we never expected the Galaxy S6 Edge to be a battery beast. However, it passed our tests. With normal use, the S6 Edge lasted about all day. With about an hour of gaming, lots of calls and texts, and boatloads of camera use, this phone couldn\u2019t last us all day, but it got us through it once we got the hang of gaming.\nIn the Geekbench 3 battery test, the S6 Edge lasts more than seven hours, while it is good for 12 hours in our own battery test. It\u2019s enough to last a normal day, but not as good as the Moto Turbo, which lasts even longer. However, it is better than the iPhone.\nAnother thing worth mentioning about the battery is the fast charging aspect. The fast charging here is the fastest we\u2019ve seen in any smartphone. The S6 Edge fully charges in less than an hour and regains enough juice in a 10-minute charge to last at least two hours.\nWith the metal and glass design, Samsung let go of its removable back cover and SD card support. While the former may annoy some users, the lack of SD card support doesn\u2019t bother me much. With Android\u2019s dismal SD card support, there\u2019s not much you can do with it anyway. The little you can do often requires a strong user approach from your smartphone.\nHowever, if you are not a power user, 32 GB or more should be enough for you. Out of the 27 GB of usable space, say about 10 GB for local music and 5 GB for games? Then you still have 12 GB of space for other apps and stuff.\nIf Samsung\u2019s goal was to take on the iPhone 6, this is the phone to compete against. The Galaxy S6 Edge outperforms the Apple iPhone 6 in terms of performance and cameras, something no Android phone can boast of. If you\u2019re looking for a flagship smartphone to buy, the Galaxy S6 Edge should definitely fit the bill.\nWhat it doesn\u2019t do is manufacturers like it Xiaomi, which will continue to enjoy their popularity in the budget segment.

At Jones Vacuum Center in Walterboro South Carolina, we are committed to protecting you and your family. At school, at home, at work, stay safe with Austin Air.\nDo Austin Air Purifiers protect against Covid-19?\nCovid-19 is a new strain of virus that as yet, remains untested. However, the Medical Grade HEPA technology used in our filters is proven to remove up to 95% of all airborne contaminants as small as 0.1 microns, as well as everyday pollutants such as dust, dander and allergens.\nThere is also emerging evidence from the UK Health Protection Agency that shows the HEGA carbon cloth, used in our Bedroom Machine, is highly effective at capturing and destroying airborne viruses.\nReducing the viral load.\nUsing an Austin Air Purifier reduces the amount of airborne virus a person may be exposed to. This helps to lessen risk in two ways. In the first instance, it may prevent them from contracting the virus altogether. And if they do become infected, it could lower the viral load in the surrounding environment. Reducing the viral load in this way gives the immune system a better chance of fighting the virus and therefore reduces the risk of serious symptoms.\nHowever, it is important to mention, that as well as airborne transmission, the virus can also be spread via surfaces and human contact. Therefore, it is vital that we regularly wash our hands.\nWhich unit should I buy?\nIf Covid-19 is your main concern, for ultimate protection, we recommend the Austin Air Bedroom Machine. The HEPA technology used in all our models effectively removes 95% of airborne viruses that are 0.1 microns and larger, as well as everyday pollutants such as dust, dander and allergens. However, the Austin Air Bedroom Machine has an extra level of protection against Covid-19, as the HEGA carbon cloth also captures and destroys airborne viruses.\nYou may also want to consider the Austin Air HealthMate and the HealthMate Plus. Both models use HEPA technology and are highly effective at removing airborne viruses and bacteria as well as other airborne allergens.

You may even have been introduced to the concept at some point in your life by someone you knew. However, it can be hard to understand some of the material and there are times when the concepts and ideas may not quite make sense. That\u2019s why it is good to have another person with you during your Kundali reading to help you grasp the concepts and ideas that are being presented. The following Kundali reading for career tips will help you to understand the concepts a little better so that you can apply them to your life and career.\nThe first thing you need to keep in mind about Kundali reading material is that it is not just about Kundali awakening. Although this is an important part of the process, you also have to learn about Kundali arousal and Kundali practice as well. This is what gives you the power to do anything you want in life. However, if you don\u2019t learn how to combine these aspects of Kundali with Kundali meditation, then none of the other aspects will happen. That is why you have to pay attention to every aspect of Kundali reading when you are focusing on getting the most from the experience.\nAnother important aspect of Kundali meditation and Kundali reading material is focusing on the spiritual self. Even if you are working with Kundali exercises, it is still important to meditate on your spiritual self because you are ultimately looking for higher purpose and desires for your life. A good Kundali reading should make you think about your goals and aspirations in a positive way so that you can get to where you want to be. You may find that this Kundali reading will give you the insight you need to reach your goals faster.\nMost people who are thinking about starting a new diet or doing Kundali meditation exercises are under the impression that they will have a great time and achieve the results they are looking for very quickly. However, if you don\u2019t pay attention to the quality of your work, you can be disappointed. You also won\u2019t get the results you are hoping for.

More than any previous job, this one will push the Leverage team to the edge of endurance in one of the world\u2019s harshest terrains, where a single wrong step could send them plunging into an almost certain death. The Leverage crew is led by former insurance investigator turned thief, Nate Ford (Timothy Hutton). His cohorts include Sophie Devereaux (Gina Bellman), a brilliant grifter; Eliot Spencer (Christian Kane), a retrieval specialist; Alec Hardison (Aldis Hodge), a gadget and technology wizard; and Parker (Beth Riesgraf), a slightly off-center thief adept at rappelling off buildings. Prior to the Alaska job, the team was laying low after finally fulfilling their obligation to a mysterious Italian agent who blackmailed Nate into hunting down a nefarious financier. The ordeal seems to have opened up a new side of Nate, who is more determined than ever to focus on bringing down bad guys. He is also reluctant to deal with the uncomfortable dynamic between him and Sophie after the two wound up in bed together.

In fact, they were so highly valued that during the Song Dynasty only the royal family were permitted to keep yellow goldfish. So you might have a bit of royalty swimming around in your fish tank.\nOther evidence suggests that the Egyptians were also trading farmed fish such as bream about 3,500 years ago. And after that the Romans got in on the act, adding a touch of luxury (would you expect anything else from the Ancient Romans?) with farmed oysters in coastal lagoons.\nLike agriculture, it seems that aquaculture sprang up independently in many different parts of the world. We\u2019ve already looked at the ancient farm in Hawaii, which is a pond created by damming a river using large stones, and which provided fish for Hawaiian royalty of the time. Seaweed is the latest ASC standard (created jointly with MSC) but the farming of this extremely versatile crop has a long history in Korea and Japan \u2013 the earliest methods used bamboo poles for spores to anchor themselves to.\nIt\u2019s simply not possible to give a thorough history of fish farming in one blog post, but I hope I\u2019ve at least highlighted that aquaculture practices have been around for a lot longer than you might think. But was I right to be surprised about this? Is it fair to refer to aquaculture as a young industry? Maybe the answer to those questions is an unsatisfactory \u201cyes and no\u201d. While fish farming has been going on for a long time, it is undeniably true that it wasn\u2019t until the 20th Century, and particularly the last few decades, that it grew into the vital global industry that it is today. Part of the reason for this rapid and recent growth is an acknowledgment that we can\u2019t meet the world\u2019s rising demand for protein with only traditional agriculture and fisheries. And while it is interesting to look back (well, it is for me and hopefully it has been for you too), what really matters is looking forward, to how we can meet this demand while minimising the environmental and social impacts.\nSo farmed seafood may be more traditional than you might think \u2013 and if you look for the ASC logo it can also help secure a responsible aquaculture industry for the future as well.", "In this summer full of heat, Rival Gaming is trying to hit a big hit with the release of his Midas Touch slot machine.

It happens that he possesses a divine power, that of transforming into gold everything he touches. In fact, this is the challenge of the Rival Gaming Midas Touch slot machine: allow you to refuel with your PC mouse. However, if you really want to do as the Phrygian monarch and serve you only with your hands, this is possible given that the slot machine is available on smartphone and tablet.\nStill, several things made us doubtful after our tests on this slot machine. The main thing is that the theme of King Midas was not really respected by the developer, who cheerfully embellished it with oranges, grapes, watermelons and other lemons, to wonder if the machine Slot is actually based on the theme of King Midas.

The fact that you can use this to benefit you in all aspects of your life makes Kundali meditation an even more appealing practice. After Kundali arousal is achieved, you\u2019ll notice things like your stress level goes down, you become more calm and compassionate, and you begin to see changes around you. These changes happen so gradually that sometimes it takes a long time for them to start really making a difference in your life, but they do.\nWhen you are looking for information on Kundali reading for career, you can find some information about Kundali arousal and Kundali meditation on the internet. However, you should be careful about the information you are getting online because many websites that offer Kundali meditation are actually scams. This means that they are just selling you a product instead of teaching you Kundali meditation and Kundali exercises.\nThe reason why you need to be careful when it comes to Kundali readings is that some of the information you get from these sites could end up damaging your health more than it helps. For example, many of the Kundali information on the internet claim that Kundali arousal will give you great physical benefits. However, if you read the fine print on some of these products, you\u2019ll discover that the benefits are far from wonderful, and they could actually be harmful to your health!\nInstead of focusing on the Kundali arousal part of Kundali readings, you need to pay attention to the other Kundali factors that are affecting your life. After all, those three things affect your mind, emotions, and body. For example, you need to pay close attention to the stress you are feeling in your life and what it is saying about you. You also need to pay attention to any negative emotional patterns that you have. These negative patterns will ultimately help you to learn the Kundali arousal path", "- This event has passed.\n4th Annual Newport Beach Food & Wine\nSeptember 29, 2017 - October 1, 2017\nNewport Beach Wine & Food is the most exclusive, intimate and world-class epicurean lifestyle event in Southern California.

(AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s largest public utility has appointed an independent panel to look into power failures that spurred the decision to implement rolling blackouts during dangerously cold conditions late last year, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced Thursday.\nThe public utility said the panel will include American Public Power Association President Joy Ditto, former Republican U.S. Sen. Bob Corker from Tennessee and retired Electric Power Research Institute CEO Mike Howard.\n\u201cThese leaders bring tremendous experience and expertise not only in public power and energy systems, but also an understanding of the growing energy needs of the region,\u201d Don Moul, TVA chief operating officer, said in a statement.\nTVA has said it takes full responsibility for the Dec. 23 and 24 rolling blackouts and is undergoing an internal review of what happened.\nTVA experienced its highest ever winter peak-power demand on Dec. 23.\nThe utility said a combination of high winds and freezing temperatures caused its coal-burning Cumberland Fossil Plant in Cumberland City to go offline when critical instrumentation froze up. The Bull Run coal-burning plant in Clinton also went offline, TVA spokesman Scott Brooks said. The utility \u201chad issues at some of our natural gas units\u201d as well, Brooks said.\nTVA said most of the local power companies it supplies were able to keep the rolling blackouts to \u201crelatively short durations\u201d for t", "Aquaculture is sometimes referred to as a young industry \u2013 and while it\u2019s true that as an industry it has really started to expand in the last three decades, the practice of farming fish has been around a lot longer than you might think \u2013 possibly even eight thousand years.\nWritten by Jack Cutforth\nIf you don\u2019t believe that, well that\u2019s understandable \u2013 I was surprised too, and to be fair it\u2019s not possible to know for certain what was going on 8,000 years ago. If only there had been a transparent certification scheme back then to record the activities of these early fish farmers, but regrettably this pre-dates written language \u2013 which would have made producing standards and audit reports challenging, to say the least.\nBut more on that later. The reason I found this out is because I learned about a more recent and verifiable \u2013 but still ancient \u2013 example of aquaculture. The Alekoko Fishpond in Hawaii was built at least 1,000 years ago and incredibly is still standing today. Large stones were used to create a 900 feet long dam to trap fish and feed local royalty.\nIt was surprising to see such an old fish farm, but would I have been as surprised to see similarly old remains of a cattle farm, or a fishing boat? It made me wonder how many other people knew just how long humans have been farming fish.\nBack to the fish farming that is \u2013 potentially \u2013 eight thousand years old. The remains were found near Melbourne in Australia, and they suggest evidence that the Aboriginal community that crafted them, the Gunditjmara, was settled rather than following the nomadic lifestyle often associated with Aboriginal culture. The remains of excavated channels were found that were used to maintain access to baby eels that migrated from the sea. Some of the traps correspond to water levels about 8,000 years ago, and their incredible age was further confirmed by radiocarbon dating of charcoal fragments that are at least 6,600 years old.\nAt some point about 4,000 years ago it seems that carp were being farmed in China. As you\u2019d expect, farming developed gradually, with these early aquaculturists taking advantage of the fact that some carp would become caught in lakes when river floodwaters subsided. Spotting an opportunity, they fed the carp and bred them, providing themselves with a reliable source of healthy protein.

Well\u2026 nearly all local, as it also included one act from Sydney (Now Zero, who eventually moved to Brisbane anyway), one from Melbourne (SonnenSystem), and one from New York (Morgan Geist).\nThese were the earliest days of the Internet and we were very active on the newsgroups of the time, so around mid-1993 in addition to placing our call-for-demos poster around the record stores of Brisbane we also posted it onto groups like rec.music.industrial and others, and got a great response.\nMany electronic musicians were (and remain) at the technical leading edge, and particularly in those early days the Internet was in the purest sense a place where like-minded boffins could communicate. Evidence \u2013 and indeed Transmission Communications (Trans:Com) \u2013 came into being largely out of a desire for creating community.\nDennis Remmer had been producing original electronic music with his mate Simon Reid as House Guests since 1987, and in 1992 they released a cassette album. Dennis needed a \u2018label name\u2019 on the sleeve to give it additional cred\u2019, so he co-opted the name \u2018Transmission\u2019 from the Joy Division song of the same name, and added \u2018Communications\u2019 (because that\u2019s what Factory did [Joy Division / New Order\u2019s label] aka Factory Communications), and a thing came into being.\nThe tape was received really well among the band\u2019s friends, and a copy was sent to Volition Records in Sydney to gauge interest. Volition \u2013 who\u2019d already had their fill of Brisbane with Boxcar and Vision Four 5 \u2013 said nothing. Thinking that the album was good enough for a CD release, but with CDs in 1993 being a very expensive proposition, and feeling DIY-energised (rather than deflated) by Volition\u2019s disinterest, the idea for a collective-style indie compilation was borne \u2013 because surely there were others in the same situation, and damn-it that\u2019s what Factory did in 1978 with their Factory Sample release \u2013 and look what they\u2019d achieved! Factory / Manchester \u2026 Trans:Com / Brisbane \u2026 there could be something in that\u2026\nSo college friends Dennis & Anastasia Petrou \u2013 who liked the House Guests and then started recording with Dennis as The Isle (and have since partnered in life) \u2013 formally registered the business name in 1993 and sent out the call for demos. The response was remarkable, and we were right \u2013 there were more than a few people producing electronic music in Brisbane. We received some wonderful demo tapes (which in itself is a notable thing \u2013 it was the golden age of the demo tape, which were always carefully packaged with custom artwork and thoughtful bios). We still have all of them.\nEventually we selected a set of tracks and the bands recorded final versions in various studios around Brisbane (if they needed to since some of the demos were fine as-is from their home 4 track studios), and sent us their masters on DAT.\nThese we collected and took into Grevillea Studios at Albion in late 1993 for mastering, under the guided hand and ears of Malcolm Jacobson. That was a fun day and completely new territory for us. We loved the process, and the final result was fantastic. I think Malcolm was bemused by our inexperience and the indie nature of the recordings, but he understood and completely respected the DIY ethic, and that it was our first foray as a label.\nThe original plan was to emulate Factory and debut with a 2 x 7\u2033 package, but local record pressing plant Sundown had just gone out of business and the price of vinyl was prohibitive, and beside CDs were the right medium for us, rather than looking backwards.

It was up to local power companies to decide how to make the reductions, and the rolling temporary power reductions were an option \u2014 not a requirement \u2014 for them, Brooks said.\nThe Nashville Electric Service, for example, said on Dec. 24 that customers should expect approximately 10-minute outages every 1.5 to 2 hours.\nBrooks said TVA doesn\u2019t have a way to track how many people lost their power due to rolling blackouts, or when. He said the local utilities that interrupted people\u2019s power kept them to less than 30 minutes at a time \u201cunless there were other issues on the local grid.\u201d\nTVA is also expected to factor in a review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which are investigating how power systems across the country operated during the winter storm.\nAdditionally, TVA\u2019s inspector general office said it is monitoring the utility\u2019s investigation to help decide what kind of inspector general reviews will be appropriate.\nThe rolling blackouts are certain to come up during the TVA board meeting on Feb. 16 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama \u2014 the first with a new majority of members picked by President Joe Biden.\nTVA provides power to 10 million people in parts of seven Southern states", "What kind of content can readers access through Between Carpools", "easily every Christmas since this is a combo that is guaranteed to slay.

The pressing costs were shared amongst the contributing artists (and quickly reimbursed upon release), and we also decided that \u2013 given the CDs \u2018were so precious\u2019 we should also press up a limited run of the compilation on cassette for promotional use, which Grevillea were able to do as they had the tape duplication facility. Dennis designed the artwork on a monochrome Mac SE (a challenge, given its a colour sleeve) using Aldus Pagemaker v4, and many lessons were learned, including what \u2018CMYK separation\u2019 means \ud83d\ude42\nThe tapes came back pretty quickly, and the CDs followed up a little later (from Singapore, for which EMI tried to hit us up for exorbitant shipping costs, which was never agreed \u2013 anyway that was sorted). We had the inserts printed locally, for which we manually included into each Digipak sleeve, and for which some people only realised that they were there many years later! Anyway some time in early 1994, at Trans:Com\u2019s HQ (our flat) in Taringa we had 500 finished Evidence compilation CDs all boxed up and ready for\u2026 what\u2019s it called again\u2026 \u2018distribution\u2019 ?\n500 copies is a minimum run, and seemed a manageable amount to deliver ourselves to indie record stores in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Indie record stores in 1994 were plentiful (remember this is way before online stores existed), so we were able to consign a handful of copies each to the likes of Rocking Horse, Kent, Skinny\u2019s, Central Station, and many others, and for which we remain grateful for the support to this day. Without indie record stores, indie bands and labels could never exist.\nBut then we had to do\u2026 what\u2019s it called again\u2026 \u2018promotion\u2019 ? We decided a launch event was necessary, so we managed to convince a venue in town (ZanZiBar \u2013 long gone now) to take us on for a night. We put up posters and distributed flyers all around town (and indeed after a conveniently-timed Depeche Mode concert at Festival Hall).\nWe also sent the promo tapes and a press release to the numerous music street papers which also existed at the time in all the major cities, as well as the indie radio stations such as 4ZZZ, 2SER, 3FBI, ABC JJJ and Radio National, etc. Looking back now, it was a good time for \u2018real\u2019 promotion (as distinct from modern reliance on social and on-line media). We also published the first of our \u2018zines (called \u2018T\u2019), which we sent out to our mailing list. Here\u2019s the first edition from the time of the Evidence release.\nThe launch was awesome, with the debut live performances from Sphere and Blood Party + The UN (who were well in advance of all of us with at least 6 performances under their belt!) and it set us on a path of many such events and releases over the years. Brisbane\u2019s electronic music scene had grown from strength to strength \u2013 which we documented in 2014 with the BNE Project, and we\u2019re very proud to say that we were there at the start\u2026 ground zero.\nAnd the music\u2026 well to this day Evidence holds a very special place in our heart, and it still sounds as wonderfully original, inventive and diverse as it did in 1994. The release spans a broad spectrum of electronic music, from the trance, house and techno of Now Zero, Evolver (later 8E38) and SonnenSystem, through the synthpop and english electronic sound of House Guests and Sphere, the electro/grebo of The UN, the darkwave of The Isle and Blood Party, to true experimentation by Ghee (Morgan Geist \u2013 providing an early cameo appearance from the USA) and Daniel Hack; in most cases the debut recordings from these artists.

But again, you are going to be extra careful with a device that costs Rs. 58,900 right?\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s the sturdiest device out there, but it\u2019s as premium as it gets. If Samsung\u2019s goal was to take on the \u2018premium-ness\u2019 of the iPhone, the S6 Edge is the one to take it on. Not the Galaxy S6, mind you, the S6 Edge.\nIt takes a while to get used to the all-new feel that a dual-edge display brings to the table, but you\u2019ll get used to it.\nI wrote in my Moto Turbo review that a QHD display on a 5.2-inch display hardly makes sense. So it shouldn\u2019t make sense on the S6 Edge\u2019s 5.1-inch screen either. Somehow Samsung makes this display feel and look so much better than anything else. Yes, I see Apple fans arguing with me about the benefits of Retina, but really, the Super AMOLED here is hands down the best display on a compact smartphone today.\nAs always, the colors are on the warmer side, but 577 ppi combined with great viewing angles, thanks to the Edge, makes this the best smartphone display today.\nWhile the curve on each side makes viewing angles feel better, the fact that your video and images also curve around the sides may be a concern for some. It hardly makes a difference to the overall experience though, so I won\u2019t complain.\nNo bloatware right? Well, that part is pretty much true. While there are quite a few pre-installed apps on this phone, it would be wrong to categorize apps like WhatsApp and Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive etc as bloated. Wish I could delete what I wanted? I sure do.\nI don\u2019t really have a problem with Touchwiz as a UI, but many things can be considered useless. Flipboard takes over the screen controlled by Google Now on the stock launcher, but it\u2019s nowhere near as seamless. Since it\u2019s a third-party app, it can\u2019t be that seamless after all. It\u2019s not stitched into the launcher like HTC\u2019s Blinkfeed or Google Now. So if you swipe to that screen, your phone will stop for a second or two while Flipboard boots up.\nNot everything is bad though, the addition of a Theme Store is good. While the Theme Store doesn\u2019t equate with themes at this point, it just means Samsung has room for improvement here, with developers or even users coming in with custom themes.\nMany called the edge display on the Galaxy Note Edge a gimmick, but the addition of a separate one presented some interesting propositions. Developers could do a lot with that screen, in fact Samsung\u2019s own features for the Note Edge were quite useful too. You won\u2019t realize all this unless you compare the Note Edge to the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.\nThere is no separate panel here, it is just one panel with curved glass, which greatly reduces the functionality. There\u2019s not much you can do with the edge other than some quick calls and different colors for some preset callers. While the Edge adds a lot to the phone\u2019s appearance, it doesn\u2019t offer much functionality.\nIf we ever do a story on \u201cX reasons to buy the S6 Edge,\u201d this and the next segment would be at the top of the list. The Exynos 7 octa SoC handles the performance part well, even better than the Moto Turbo. Does the S6 Edge get hot? Yes it does, and you", "What features do Indespension plant trailers have that make them suitable for road use in Europe"]}
